I'm an Apple fan boy and I love all things Mac, especially their iOS products. I'm a music and film buff and I spend a lot of time outside outdoors.  I'm also an a photography buff with not only an interest in taking the photos, but in collecting the equipment.

These are the things I use:

### Computer

Macbook Pro 2011 Unibody version with 17" and i7 Intel processor. Â I've upgraded mine with an Intel SSD boot drive and removed the DVD drive and added 1 TB HD where I keep my home folders. Â It has 8gigs of memory and it screams. Â I spend most of my time sitting in front of it, so it has to be a work horse which it is.

I'm also running Mac OS 10.7 Lion which is a pretty solid upgrade from Snow Leopard. One of the things I really like about it is the performance. It starts fast, launchs apps fast and copies files fast. Plus it is optimized for SSD hard drives which I am currently using.

### Backup

I'm a mobile employee meaning that I don't work at my company's headquarters. Â I fly in every other week for a few days and mostly work out of my home. Â I love the lifestyle, but it means I need to take extra precaution with backing up my data. Â I don't get the luxury of IT services doing it for me.

As a result, I backup to two spots. Â Locally to a HD and remotely to Amazon S3 storage. Â For local backups, I like SPEED so I bought an inexpensive ESATA card for my notebooks card slot. Â I chose Sonnet Technologies single port ESATA card which sits flush with my Mac when inserted.

The card can be purchased from [Amazon][1] for less than $50. Â For the HD, I prefer Caldigit products, especially the VR mini. Â This is a dual drive RAID box that is bus powered and has a quad interface. Â Its on the pricer side at close to $500, but it provides easy access to remove the drives, storage cases for long term storage and a great warranty. Â Plus its blazing fast.

And oh my does it look good. Â I use the ESATA interface on the back of the drive which also requires that I use the Firewire 800 port to deliver power.

For backup to this drive, I use SuperDuper which creates an image of my HD. Â In my case I've got two drives, so I make two images. Â Boot and Home. Â These images can easily be copied to other drives or mounted if I need to retrieve data.

For backup to Amazon S3, I chose [Arq][2] which has been flawless for me. Â (I've had several cases to restore.) Â There are a lot of other users who prefer Arq mainly because it is reliable, it encrypts data locally so that Amazon employees cannot gain access to your data. Â It is also fast, using up all of my bandwidth if I want it to. Â You can restrict it too if you are worried about quotas.

For long term backup storage, I use a command line utility called [Tarsnap][3]. Â This guy lets me encrypt and backup to Amazon S3. Â It is probably the most secure Amazon based backup service.

### Audio

I spend a lot of time on Skype for work so I like to use headphones with a built in mic. Â This reduces the background noise for my fellow Skype users and it allows me to hear their conversations better. Â I think Bowers and Wilkins makes one of the best headphones and the P5 is as good as it gets. Â This model has a built in mic so it works great for Skype. Â It is lightweight so you can travel with it too. Â Be prepared to spend $299 on it though.

For general music listening and travel I prefer a more durable headphone. Â (I'm a shop-a-holic when it comes to audio.) Â I recently bought the AIAIAI TMA-1 headphones which cost $220. Â The reason I love these headphones is that they are comfortable both on and off. Â (Sitting on your neck.) Â So they make a great travel headphone as I can wear them on my neck through the airport, waiting to get on the plane, etc.. Â They are very durable and they look indiscreet. Â You would have no idea that these suckers cost more than $200. Â I though the detachable cord was a bit heavy so I replaced it with a red Monster Cable Beats cord from an older pair of headphones. Â It looks really good actually.

If you don't use the Monster cable, I would recommend a flat cable, maybe something like this [Griffin][4] one for less than $10.

### Backpacks & Bags

Since I travel a lot, I am very particular about the type of bag that I use to carry my gear. Â I've gotten pretty good at traveling light, so I don't pack too much gear so I use a backpack. Â I'm a big fan of Incase and I've been using their Nylon backpack which not only holds my laptop, but also has a slot for my iPad. Â It really is the perfect backpack.

You can get one for around $100. Â I also like their iPhone cases, but I don't use a case on mine.

My newest backpack and the one that I've been using over the Incase bag is the [Lexdray Tokyo Pack][5] which is 4x the price of the Incase bag, but the quality is better, there is more storage and it has a few features that the Incase doesn't have including a built in rain cover.

### Software

My early years in technology revolved around software so I'm very picky about what I use. I change my toolset quite a bit jumping around to what I think is the best tool at the time.
