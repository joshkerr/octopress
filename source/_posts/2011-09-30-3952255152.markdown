<p>While working on a story about citizen journalism at the <a href="http://occupywallstreet.org">Occupy Wall Street</a> protests in New York for  PBS affiliate <a href="http://www.thirteen.org/">WNET Thirteen</a>, reporter John Farley was arrested, along with the demonstrators whose stories he was covering.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>My arrest gave me a unique vantage point on the risks and rewards of citizen journalists, those non-professionals who capture stories (usually without pay) using videos and images via portable technology like a cell phone camera. Anyone, even a passerby or a police officer can be a citizen journalist. That’s its power.</p>
