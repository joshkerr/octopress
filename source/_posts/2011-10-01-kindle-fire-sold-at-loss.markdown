<p>This is a smart move on Amazon's part.  The iPad is on fire, the only way to break in is to undercut with price and provide compelling content.  Amazon is doing both.</p>

<p><img src="http://photos.macnn.com/news/1109/amazonkindlefire-2.jpg" border="0" alt="" width="176" height="120" align="left" />Amazon's Kindle Fire is being sold at a loss to heat up competition with Barnes &amp; Noble and Apple, IHS iSuppli estimated Friday.  Based on a list of known and expected components, it believes the seven-inch mini tablet costs $209.63 in raw parts and manufacturing, or about $10 less than its $$199 asking price.  A high-quality IPS-based LCD at $87 is a large part of that cost,  while adding the dual-core TI OMAP processor and other mainboard components pushes it up by another $70.40<img src="http://amch.questionmarket.com/adsc/d887846/17/909940/adscout.php" border="0" alt="" width="0" height="0" /></p>
