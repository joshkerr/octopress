HP's board could be the worst ever according to a Wall Street Journal [article].  They've made some pretty bad decisions starting with Carly Fiorina and going all the way to today's leak that they plan to fire current CEO Leo Apotheker.  I've got a soft spot in my heart for HP ever since my first job out of college at Compaq.  (HP acquired Compaq in 2002.)

HP's recent history has more the makings of a bad movie than it does a public corporation.  I get the feeling that my grandmother would make a better board member than any of the current board.
