I migrated my personal blog back to Jekyll, the static site generator that runs in Ruby.  I bounce around quite a bit from different blog publishing platforms so it isn't unusual for me to switch after a few months.  Jekyll is all about simplicity so for now, you could say that my reasons for the switch are about getting back to something a bit simpler.  

As social media becomes more important in our lives, blogging is becoming less important.  If I want to blog for my friends, I post to Facebook.  If I want to blog for my work colleagues, I blog to LinkedIn.  Blogging to a website is less meaningful these days.

Jekyll forces me to focus on content which makes my blog entries more relevant.  It does this by removing the WYSIWYG web based blogging interface and replacing it with a simple text editor.  This removes my desire of adding useless images (like the one above) and instead, write meaningful dialog (like this really wonderful paragraph.)
