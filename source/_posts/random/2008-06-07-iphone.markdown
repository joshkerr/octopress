<p>I did get around to jailbreaking my iPhone.  I did it about six months ago but quickly restored my phone to the non-jailbreak status because there weren't any decent apps available.</p>
<p>A week ago I jailbroke it again and now there are great apps for it.  There has certainly been a lot of development for the iPhone over the last six months.  My iPhone will stay jailbroken until the official apps appear.</p>
