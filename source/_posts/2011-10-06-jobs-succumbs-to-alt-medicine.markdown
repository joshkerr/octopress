<p>I'm not sure if I believe this story, but if it is true, it is sad.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most pancreatic cancers are aggressive and always terminal, but Steve was lucky (if you can call it that) and had a rare form called an islet cell neuroendocrine tumor, which is actually quite treatable with excellent survival rates — if caught soon enough. The median survival is about a decade, but it depends on how soon it’s removed surgically. Steve caught his very early, and should have expected to survive much longer than a decade. Unfortunately Steve relied on a naturopathic diet instead of early surgery. There is no evidence that diet has any effect on islet cell carcinoma. <a href="http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2008/06/13/steve-jobs-life-after-the-whipple/">As he dieted for nine months</a>, the tumor progressed, and took him from the high end to the low end of the survival rate.</p>
