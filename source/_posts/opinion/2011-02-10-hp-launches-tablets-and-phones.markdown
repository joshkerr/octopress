I used to work for Compaq which was acquired by HP.  Compaq was a great place to work and it was my first job out of college.  I should feel loyal to the company and write a raving review about their newly announced tablet and phones.  If they had launched this stuff a year ago, I'd be pretty enthusiastic, but with the iPad 2 and iPhone 5 on the horizon, HP has a lot of catching up to do.

There is one feature though that I think is pretty innovative.  HP showed how you could browse a web page on the tablet, then bump the phone against the table and the web page link transfers to the phone and then loads.  I'm not sure what the use case is for this, but it seeing devices communicate wirelessly based on proximity is exciting.

Will I go out and buy a Palm product?  No.
