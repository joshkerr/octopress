<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/06/07/iphone-4-vs-iphone-3gs-the-tale-of-the-tape/">Engadget&#8217;s handiwork</a>, we now have a stat breakdown of the iPhone 4 vs. the older model.</p>
<p>Standout Numbers:</p>
<ul><li>Quadband HSDPA.  That means likely T-Mobile 3G compatible. </li>
<li>Wireless: 802.11N finally - though iOS 4 might enable it on the 3GS</li>
<li>Gyroscope will do some interesting things.  Air mouse for instance - perhaps gaming on AppleTVs in the future?</li>
<li>Facetime is now an open standard which means Apple and partners will be building for other platforms like gulp* Android.</li>
<li>More Battery life, up to an hour of talk time more - that is a big one over Android who already lags in battery.</li>
<li>It weighs a few gams more but now is less than a centimeter thick!</li>
