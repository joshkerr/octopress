<p>Everyone seems to think the iPhone is coming to Verizon.  The WSJ and NY Times are both confirming the news.  It wouldnt be the first time that these rumors have been wrong.   I cant see why Apple would want to leak anything about an iPhone on Verizon when it would hurt their holiday sales with people waiting to buy a Verizon phone over AT&T.  Still, the rumor is out there and more people are confirming it.  Would you buy a Verizon iPhone?  I dont think I would.</p>
