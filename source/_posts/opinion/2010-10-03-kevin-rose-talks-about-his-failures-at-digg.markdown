<p>Ive always been a fan of Kevin Rose and Digg used to be a site that I would visit almost daily.  The latest release of Digg has been a failure.  I dont visit it anymore.  Kevin sat in for a tough interview with Michael Arrington on TechCrunch Disrupt.</p>
<p>I give Kevin props for doing the interview, but he blunders his way through the talk and the result doesnt help him or Digg.  He seemed unprepared for these very obvious questions.</p>
