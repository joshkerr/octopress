<p>We’ve once again taken our good buddy Phil Nickinson’s <a href="http://www.androidcentral.com/droid-incredible-vs-evo-4g-vs-nexus-one">Android Central tech spec sheet</a> featuring the Droid Incredible, Evo 4G, and Nexus One, and added in Apple’s just-announced <a href="http://www.tipb.com/iphone-4/">iPhone 4</a> and we gotta tell ya — smartphones have never been this good. Everyone is firing on all cylinders these days and from the highly polished package that is Apple’s latest iPhone 4 to the power and diversity of Google’s Android platform, consumers are the true winners.</p>
<p>For those of you who love your spec porn, there it is up top, and we’re honestly beginning to wonder — what could they possibly do next? (Besides mind-control, of course).<img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheIphoneBlog/~4/0mGPtjKh_wU" alt="" width="1" height="1"/></p>
