title: Apple purposely adds bugs to iOS releases
excerpt: Don't complain about bugs in a beta version of anything.
category: opinion

I recently read a rant by a user who was testing iOS 4.3 beta 3 and complained that all three beta releases had an annoying bug that caused his folders to disappear on his springboard and the icons set to default layout.  I think Apple is doing this on purpose to prevent users from deploying beta versions.

I could see many reasons for Apple doing this, but the big one is that they enable features in a beta that they wanted tested and then disable them in a release.  Tethering is a good one.  I also think they users of beta copies create more support incidents which can be costly for a company that has such a large customers base.

Either way, I don't see why a user would complain about this.  The software is beta for a reason.  End of rant.
