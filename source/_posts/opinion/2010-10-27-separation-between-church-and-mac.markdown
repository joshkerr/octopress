I looked at my dock today and noticed a cross sitting where the download folder should reside.  It appears as though my Mac thinks I'm Christian.  I'm actually not, I'm Jewish, but how did I cross get into my dock?  Is it a virus?
	
It turns out that I had several images both horizontal and vertical sitting in that folder and OSX uses some kind of formula to generate an icon showing you the contents of the folder.  In my case it just ended up being a cross. 
	
And I thought Steve Jobs was trying to convert me
