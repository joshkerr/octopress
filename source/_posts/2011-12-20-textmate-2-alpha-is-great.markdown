I'm a big fan of Textmate, I've been using it as my goto Mac code/text editor for more than a few years.  Over that time, the app has remained exactly the same.  The developer would fix bugs every now and then, but the app itself did not progress.  

New editors would popup every now and then, but Textmate continued to be the best of breed.  This was partly because it was extensible and the developer community was thriving.  So I continued to use it.

A few years ago the developer blogged about working on a version 2 of the app.  No details on when or what the version 2 would be and for another year we saw no major release.  Then a few months ago the developer posted a teaser screenshot.  This month we received our first version 2 Alpha copy.  Finally, after years of waiting there is a significatly new version of Textmate.

The new version feels modern.  It has a modern clean interface, very similar to the 1.0 version, but with polish and UI tweaks that make it feel pretty slick.  It doesn't get in the way of what makes Textmate so great, the ability to edit.  

As an editor, version 2 is just plain awesome.  Multiple carets, the ability to create multiple selections in a single view is really useful.  Its basically a discontinuous selection.

Another really cool feature is the project drawer which is found on most editors, but for some reason wasn't included in 1.0.  With 2.0, the drawer now only shows files and folders, but updates status on SCM, can execute commands, supports smart folders and much more.
