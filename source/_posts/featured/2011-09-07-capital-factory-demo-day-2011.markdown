## Demo Day

![CapitalShot][]

Today was Demo Day at [Capital Factory] where 5 mentored companies showed their wares and 19 other companies pitched to raise money from the 200 or so investors in attendance.  

This was my first year as a Capital Factory mentor and I was lead mentor on a startup called [HelpJuice].  Emil, an 18 year old Bosnian founded [HelpJuice] and joined Capital Factory shortly before launching a beta of this product.  Today was the culimnation of 3 months of hard work and a coming out for Emil as he demoed his product in front of many enthusiastic members of the press and investors who would likely invest in his company.

To say it was a successful day is an understatement.  Emil and the other [Capital Factory] companies shined in what was no only a great success for the early stage startup incubator, but for Austin proper as out of state money flowed in to what is becoming a bigger challenge to Silicon Valley for more of the startup investment cash.  

At the Angel level (which all [Capital Factory] companies were looking to raise) Austin is a breeding ground for great ideas as the community fosters innovation and does away with petty competition instead providing a solid foundation for growth and easy access to adult supervision, the experienced mentors who help guide your path.

###  Bob Metcalfe

The keynote speaker was Bob Metcalfe the bloke who invented Ethernet and later founded 3Com and had me grabbing my gut in pain as I rolled in laughter from his dry sarcastic humor.  His experience made more lavish by weaving in personal stories about Steve Jobs provided lots of lessons for not only the novice CEO, but also for those with experience.

### Brian Sharples

The other speakers included Brian Sharples the CEO of HomeAway and Auren Hoffman the CEO of RapLeaf.  Both speakers brought a lot of value sharing their own personal experiences and doing post talk question and answer sessions.

All in all it was a fantastic day for the Austin startup community.  [Capital Factory] put on a wonderful show and the hard work of the 5 companies who transformed into Cinderella will certainly go on to grow into great success.
