<p>Monster Cable has a history of suing competitors that infringe on their patents.  Usually the competitor fearing an expensive trial, obtains and a license from Monster and moves on.</p>
<p>This is decidely not what happened when Monster <a href="http://www.audioholics.com/news/industry-news/monster-sues-blue-jeans-cable">sued</a> <a href="http://www.bluejeanscable.com/">Blue Jeans Cables</a>.  Nope.  You see Blue Jean's President is actually a former litigation attorney and his <a href="http://www.audioholics.com/news/industry-news/blue-jeans-strikes-back">response</a> to Monster recently made public is legendary.</p>
<p>He puts a huge burden on Monster to demonstrate the infringement, asks for documents from all successful patent filings, cases, etc..</p>
<p>Then, he asks for all documents relating to Monster's offshore tax haven:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.75em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.5em;"><em>I assume that Monster Cable International, Ltd., in Bermuda, listed on these patents, is an IP holding company and that Monster Cable's principal US entity pays licensing fees to the Bermuda corporation in order to shift income out of the United States and thereby avoid paying United States federal income tax on those portions of its income; my request for these licensing agreements is specifically intended to include any licensing agreements, including those with closely related or sham entities, within or without the Monster Cable "family," and without regard to whether those licensing agreements are sham transactions for tax shelter purposes only or whether they are </em><em>bona fide arm's-length transactions.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally he ends talking about about his career in law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1985, I spent nineteen years in litigation practice, with a focus upon federal litigation involving large damages and complex issues.  My first seven years were spent primarily on the defense side, where I developed an intense frustration with insurance carriers who would settle meritless claims for nuisance value when the better long-term view would have been to fight against vexatious litigation as a matter of principle.  In plaintiffs' practice, likewise, I was always a strong advocate of standing upon principle and taking cases all the way to judgment, even when substantial offers of settlement were on the table.  I am "uncompromising" in the most literal sense of the word.  If Monster Cable proceeds with litigation against me I will pursue the same merits-driven approach; I do not compromise with bullies and I would rather spend fifty thousand dollars on defense than give you a dollar of unmerited settlement funds.  As for signing a licensing agreement for intellectual property which I have not infringed: that will not happen, under any circumstances, whether it makes economic sense or not.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Monster should stay away from this one at all costs.</p>
