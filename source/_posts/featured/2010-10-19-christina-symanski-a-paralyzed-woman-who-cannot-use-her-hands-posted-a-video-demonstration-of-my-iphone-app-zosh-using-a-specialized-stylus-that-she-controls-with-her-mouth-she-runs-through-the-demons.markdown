title: paralyzed woman does a video review of my app
category: featured
---

Christina Symanski, a paralyzed woman who cannot use her hands, posted a video demonstration of my iPhone app Zosh using a specialized stylus that she controls with her mouth. She runs through the demonstration with such ease that I don't know if I could've done a better job.

Zosh lets you fill in and sign documents from your mobile phone. I started the company with my co-founder and good friend Alexander Bibighaus a few years back as a side project. In March of this year we released the product and it became an instant hit.
 I've always considered my target audience people that could benefit from not having to be tied down to a fax machine to fill in a form or document and sign it. Christina fits that mold, but to see her benefit from Zosh without using her hands really made me feel proud of what we built.
