![Is that Zosh in the screenshot?](http://i.imgur.com/lgmd6.png)

So I'm browsing the net looking for a [Delicious] client for the Mac and I find this page which has a lovely screenshot with [Zosh] in it!  For those of you that don't know, Zosh is my former startup that I co-founded and eventually sold to YouSendIt.

What are the odds that someone has a screenshot of my startup's homepage on their product website?  Awesome!

See their website: [Delish]
