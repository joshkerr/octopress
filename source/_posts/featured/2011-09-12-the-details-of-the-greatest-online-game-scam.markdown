[Eve] is a fantastic space MMORPG that has a very sophisticated monetary system very much like the US, but without the regulation.  So, two guys decide to create a financial institution called [Phaser, Inc.] and go on to scam gamers out of a Trillion dollars of online money.  

The money stolen wasn't actual US currency, but the value is about 150 million ISK to 15 USD.  So the total amount stolen is about $7K USD, but in the game, the 1 Trillion is actually a lot of cash.

So how did these two guys do it?  Well, they setup an investment company.  Users registered for an account and then deposited game currency.  Depositers were promised a return on their investement and for a time, were actually paid interest and were allowed to withdraw their money.  At the peak there was over 1.8 trillion invested.  

At some point in time, the [Phaser, Inc.] guys decide to steal the invested cash.  So they took 1 trillion ISK and shutdown the system.  

An amazing online heist that shows you that even gamers can be suckers.  Who can you trust these days?
