<p>It is pretty insane that all one has to do to get a website to remove content is complain that the content is hurting their image. Â Whether true or not and without any sort of third party discussion, the website has 48 hours to remove the offending content.</p>
<p>This law is going to seriously limit free speech in Italy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This proposal, which the Italian Parliament is currently debating, provides, among other things, a requirement to all websites to publish, within 48 hours of the request and without any comment, a correction of any content that the applicant deems detrimental to his/her image.</p>
</blockquote>
