If you download TV shows on your computer, chances are good you get them from iTunes.  Nothing wrong with that.  If you are a bit more technical, then you might download your shows from news groups.  If you are even more technical, you use NZB files and download your shows from indexed websites.  If you are even more technical, you've got [Sabnzbd][] setup and you use that to process your downloads.  In this article, I'm going to show you how to setup [Sickbeard][] to automatically download your TV shows.
