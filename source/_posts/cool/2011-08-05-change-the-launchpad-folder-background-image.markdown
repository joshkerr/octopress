<h3>Change the Launchpad Folder Background Image in Mac OS X 10.7 Lion</h3>
<h4>Tired of the linen background image of folders in Launchpad? You can easily change it to anything you want with this simple walkthrough…. you have to use a PNG file, so find one that you want as the new Launchpad folder background image.</h4>
<p>Remember when we pointed you to a nine step process that taught you how to change your <a href="http://www.macstories.net/links/changing-os-x-lion%E2%80%99s-mission-control-and-dashboard-image-backgrounds/">Dashboard and Mission Control backgrounds</a>? You can even change the background of your Launchpad wallpaper thanks to <a href="http://osxdaily.com/2011/08/03/change-launchpad-folder-background-image-mac-os-x-lion/">OS X Daily</a>, whom ask that you prepare a PNG (hopefully one that tiles nicely) before walking through the five required steps. You’re basically just swapping out an image with another image via the Finder, which makes backing up the resource you’re replacing pretty easy. I’d create a backup folder in your user folder before making any changes — that way you have all of the old resources in one rememberable location.</p>
