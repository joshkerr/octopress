<p>Okay, this is really cool.  Since 90% of the makeup of a common household cleaner is water, why not ship it without the water and let the consumer fill it with their own?  I imagine this saves huge on shipping costs especially if these cleaners are being flown from somewhere.  The product is appropriately called <a href="http://www.myreplenish.com/rethink-the-bottle.html">Replenish</a>.</p>
