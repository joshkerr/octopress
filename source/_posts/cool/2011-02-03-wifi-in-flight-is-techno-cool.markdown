I've seen many journalists blog about the convenience of accessing the Internet via an airplane flight.  I've been taking regular flights between Austin and San Jose and the flight (Alaska airlines) has wifi.  No only do they have wifi, they have really fast wifi.  I have no idea what technology is required to make this marvel possible, but wow is it cool.  

I remember reading about Gizmodo editor Lam's first flight on Virgin and having wifi.  He blogged about it as if it was the best thing since sliced bread.  I feel the same way every time I get the opportunity to use it.  How is it that at 35,000 feet I can access the Internet?  Really cool.
