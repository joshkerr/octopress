[Ars Technica] wrote about a new came called Gunpoint which is in development by a guy who writes for PC Gamer.  The game has this 8bit graphics that remind me of the days of Leisure Suit Larry and make me really want to play his game.  

In the game you are a secret agent and you have to steal data from a computer.  What I love about the game is that you can rewire each level to meet the needs of the character in the game.  For example, guards don't like the dark, so if you turn off the lights, the guards will go to the nearest light switch to turn them back on.   So you can rewire the light switches so that when a guard switches the light switch, a door opens instead of turning on the lights.  Its really hard to explain, so check out video:

Unfortunately the game is under development and not completed.

Get this thing out soon.  Please.
