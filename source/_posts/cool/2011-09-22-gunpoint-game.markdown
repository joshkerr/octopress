[Ars Technica] wrote about a new came called Gunpoint which is in development by a guy who writes for PC Gamer.  The game has this 8bit graphics that remind me of the days of Leisure Suit Larry and make me really want to play his game.  Unfortunately the game is under development and not completed.

Get this thing out soon.  Please.
