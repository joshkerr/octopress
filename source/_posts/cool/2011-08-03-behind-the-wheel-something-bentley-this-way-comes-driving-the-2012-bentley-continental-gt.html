<p>Amazing test drive of the 2012 Bentley Continental GT</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we <a href="http://gearpatrol.com/blog/2011/07/14/preview-something-bentley-this-way-comes/">mentioned</a>, earlier this summer GP got the chance to dive into the fabled world of <a href="http://www.bentleymotors.com/">Bentley Motors</a>. Immersing ourselves in a century’s worth of motoring history the marquee boasts, we took an in-depth look at everything from Bentley’s bespoke coachbuilding process to an all-access look at Bentley’s factory grounds. And of course, time <a href="http://gearpatrol.com/blog/category/vehicles/behind-the-wheel/">behind the wheel</a> in the devastatingly handsome <a href="http://www.bentleymotors.com/models/new_continental_gt/">2012 Continental GT</a>.</p>
<p>We’ll be bringing this to you over a series of several posts, but it’s Wednesday so why not start with dessert: a photo essay. Dive in right after the jump.</p>
