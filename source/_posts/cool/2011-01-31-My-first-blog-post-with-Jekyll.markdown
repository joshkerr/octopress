<div class="notice">Welcome to the newly simplified joshkerr.com</div>

I was browsing through Github recently and stumbled on to a ruby gem called [Jekyll][].  The app is the latest in semantic blogging.  Basically it separates content from presentation.  It also does away with a lot of the server technologies used to power a site like Wordpress (my old blog software) and instead, generates static files.  Now I can write blog articles from my Macbook and publish them at my leisure.

I found a bunch of blog posts of other users who have recently switched to Jekyll from Wordpress.  Seems the first post for many is "hey, I just switched and this is why.."  

Jekyll is not for the casual blogger.  Installing it is a whole project in itself.  But once you get it up and running, it is easy to use.   

This is a good tutorial to get you started: [JekyllTutorial][]

I love the syntax highlighting feature:

{% highlight ruby %}
def foo
  puts 'foo'
end
{% endhighlight %}
