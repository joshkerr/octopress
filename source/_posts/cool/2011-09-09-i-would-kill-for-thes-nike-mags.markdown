Nike plans to create the Back to the Future II sneakers: Nike Mags and auction them off on eBay starting tonight.  I would kill for these sneakers.  (Don't get between me and my auction tonight.)  As a kid, these were pretty much my dream sneakers and for some odd reason, Nike never made them.  Until now.

 Update: I bid on a pair on eBay.
