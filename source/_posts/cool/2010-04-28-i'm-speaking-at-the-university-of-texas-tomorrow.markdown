<p>The University of Texas has a program called <a href="http://3daystartup.com/">3 Day Startup</a> which puts students in an office for 3 days and gives them all the materials they need to start a company.  They choose the most promising idea and try to get it off the ground.  If the project is successful, the company continues to grow after the 3 days.  Either way, its great experience for the students and encourages a lot of great ideas.  The program organized a series of guest speakers including Brett Hurt CEO of Bazzarvoice, Joshua Baer CEO of Otherinbox.  I'm the last of the speakers to go and I'm going to be talking about my experiences both successes and more importantly failures.  I'm also going to talk about why I love what I do and what I see for myself in the future.  There will be some Q&A (probably a lot of it.)</p>

<p>I was a UT computer science student in the early 90's and I haven't been back to the computer science campus since I graduated.  So this will be a bit of a homecoming for me.  I'm reminded of when I was a marketing student and in my junior year decided I wanted to change my major to computer science.  My advisor told me that I was unfit to be a computer science student and I should just stay the course.  I argued and she unwillingly let me into the program.  Little did she know that I would thrive in the program and go on to greater success.  Tomorrow should be fun.</p>
