<p>TUAW posted a quick review of the iPhone 4 case from Arkhippo which is actually pretty neat.  The case itself is the size of a small brick which gives it some added usefulness.  It protects your phone like no other, but it also doubles as a stand (using its bulk) which means you can rest it on your dashboard while using the nav.  Cool.</p>
