<p>According to a <a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/company/survey-results/mobile-developer-report-july-2011/">study</a> by Appcelerator 22% of the 2000+ developers said that iCloud is a major new growth opportunity.  This news could mean that iCloud is already steam rolling to become the dominant cloud service platform and that its competitors Dropbox, Box.net, etc.. need to worry and fast.</p>
<p>This comes as no surprise after watching attending WWDC this past summer.  Apple has some of the most powerful tools with Xcode and the iOS platform and integrating cloud service at that level is a win for both Apple and Developers.</p>
