<p>Mars Edit for the Mac now supports Tumblr.  While the support is beta, it seems to work pretty well.  I do like the idea of editing documents on my desktop rather than in the web, but with the improvements of WordPress, I've been using the web more for editing online content.  I'm actually starting to prefer it.</p>
