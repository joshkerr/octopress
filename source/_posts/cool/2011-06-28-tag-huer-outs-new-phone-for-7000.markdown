<p>I have no idea why Tag Heuer would want to make a <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/28/tag-heuer-outs-6-700-link-phone-for-those-who-like-alligator-sk/">phone</a>, especially when Apple and Android dominate the market with products that have so much more tech.  If I want a phone that looks like a watch, I'll buy a watch and keep my iPhone.<br/>
