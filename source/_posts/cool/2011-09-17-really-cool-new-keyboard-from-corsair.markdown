Corsair just came out with a new gaming keyboard for FPS gamers that aims to help you dominate Call of Duty with these interchangeable keys that angle to make your hands sit more comfortably.   It also has a wrist rest for your left hand which looks comfortable too.

The keyboard looks great.  I love the contrast of red and black keys wtih the steel keyboard bottom.

Its about $120 and available now.
