<p>Google released its Chrome Web Store today and I have to admit, I think they are on to something.  I think one of the major shortcomings with web apps is that they run in a browser and the general consensous of users is that they are pages, not apps.  They can't retain state, they have to be refreshed, and they crash and loose data often.</p>
<p>All of this is untrue if you are building web apps in HTMl5.  But the general population doesn't know it.  So why not create a web app store.  This instills confidence in the user that the pages are actually apps and that they will behave like apps.  I think Google did a good job with its version of the app store. </p>
<p>I'm a regular Chrome users so I'll make good use it if.</p>
