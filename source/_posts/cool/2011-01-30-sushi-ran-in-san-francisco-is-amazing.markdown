<p>I love Sushi.  I eat it all the time.  Last week on of of my colleagues at work took me to one of the best Sushi restaurants in the US.  <a href="http://www.sushiran.com">Sushi Ran</a>.</p>
<p>We sat at the Sushi bar and ate Omakase where the chef chooses our dishes.  There were three of us and sushi was served three at a time so that we could each sample a piece before the next round.  The fish was fantastic, the service was great and overall it was one my favorite Sushi meals.  I will be going back if I can get a reservation.</p>
<p>Speaking of reservations, make sure to make one well in advance. Â The restaurant is small and it is very popular.</p>
