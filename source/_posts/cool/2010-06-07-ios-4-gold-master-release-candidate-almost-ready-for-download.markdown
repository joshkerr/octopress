The <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">iPhone OS 4.0 SDK</span> <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2010/06/07/wwdc-2010-iphone-os-4-now-ios-4/">iOS 4 SDK</a> is almost (but not quite) ready to roll for all members of Apples developer program, not just the paid App Store developers. And paid devs are almost ready to finally start shipping apps leveraging the new firmwares amazingly cool features. We cant wait until we start seeing VoiP and Game Center apps in action.<br/><br/> Today, youll be able to head on over to <a href="http://developer.apple.com/iphone"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Apples developer site</span></a> and start downloading your copy of the 4.0 SDK release candidate. Although the site still shows beta 4, the gold master release candidate, as Steve announced at the Keynote this morning, should be ready momentarily.<br/><br/> Of course, the <a href="http://tuaw.com/tag/ipad">iPad</a> SDK is another matter. Any iPad SDK, when it appears (likely in the fall sometime), will remain under an ongoing NDA until that firmware and SDK is officially released. But the good news is that the new version of the iPhone firmware is <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2010/06/07/wwdc-2010-second-generation-ipod-touch-gets-free-update-to-ios4/">just around the corner on June 21st</a>.</p>
