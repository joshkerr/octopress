Tech Tool Pro is a long time leader in Mac repair and diagnostics.  It used to be bundled with new Mac purchases as part of the Apple Care warranty.

One of the best features in the product is its ability to boot from a DVD and repair your system.  Ever since the release of EFI firmware Macs, the bootable DVD hasn't worked.  Now, with the release of Tech Tool Pro version 6, you can create an e-drive bootable partition on your Mac and repair without needing a DVD.

I haven't tried it yet, but its the logical next step in bootable diagnostics, especially considering the future of computing doesn't have an optical media drive.  Take for instance that new Macbook Airs come with media on a USB stick.

I can see problems with the bootable partition scheme though.  What if you need to repair the drive with the bootable partition?  Maybe you boot off a clone on an external drive?

Also new with Tech Tool Pro 6 is a cloning feature.  I'm a big fan of cloning, it keeps a fully working disk on hand so that if I do have a failure, I can boot in seconds off the clone and keep on working.

I bought a copy of Tech Tool 6 and plan to take it through its paces.
