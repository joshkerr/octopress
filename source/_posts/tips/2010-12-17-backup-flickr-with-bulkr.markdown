title: Backup Flickr with Bulkr

<p>Now that Yahoo is going down the tubes, I'm going to grab all of my Flickr images in case that goes down without warning. Â I recommend <a href="http://clipyourphotos.com/bulkr">Bukr</a> which runs on Adobe Air (making it compatible with Windows, Mac, etc..)</p>
<p><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Bulkr.png" alt="Bulkr screenshot" width="456" height="188"/></p>
<p>Better get them while you still can.</p>
