<p>I'm a big fan of <a href="http://macromates.com/">Textmate</a> the text editor for Mac OSX.  Today I found an open source project called <a href="http://www.kodapp.com">Kod</a> which aims to become a powerful editor and free competitor to apps like Textmate and BBEdit.</p>

<p>A very early beta version is now available on their <a href="http://www.kodapp.com">website</a><br/></p>
