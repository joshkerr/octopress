title: SuperDuper! is the best Mac backup app
excerpt: I sleep soundly at night knowing that I can easily boot from a spare drive and have my OS restored very quickly.

I'm in love with the Mac app [SuperDuper!][].  I am not in love with Time Machine.  Time Machine is a resource hog, it has no configuration options (save for hacking the command line,) and it results in a non-bootable backup.  This means that you'll need to reinstall your OS, then restore from Time Machine.

SuperDuper! makes these pains go away.  First, the app creates a bootable image of your current Mac's disk.  This means if you ever run into a problem, you can simply boot from an external drive (with that image) and you are back in business.  Buy a new hard drive, clone the image right to that drive.  It couldn't be more flexible and I love it.

SuperDuper! is easy to setup with minimal options.  Just choose the drive to backup and the drive to save the image to.  It could take quite a while to do a full backup, but after the first backup, you can have it to differential backups so that each followup backup goes faster.

For me, Time Machine is disabled and SuperDuper! is keeping me safe.
