<p>I saw this tip on Mac OS Hints and thought I'd share it.   This is a very easy way to join together two video files into one large file.  I've tested it with AVI and MP4 which are both video container files so I can't say if it works on other file types.</p>
<pre>cat video1.avi video2.avi > video1and2.avi</pre>
<p>Next open the video in Quicktime X and re-save it.  Done.</p>
