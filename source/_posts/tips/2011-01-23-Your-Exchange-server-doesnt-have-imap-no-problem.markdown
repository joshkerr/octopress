Enter [Davmail][]. This handy Mac app will take the Outlook Web Access that your company provides and transform it into a host of services: IMAP, POP, SMTP, LDAP and more. Now you can use a real email client to compose emails, lookup employee. You can even hookup a calendar that supports Caldav like iCal.
