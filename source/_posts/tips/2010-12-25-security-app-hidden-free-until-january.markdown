Mac anti-theft software <a href="http://hiddenapp.com/">Hidden</a> is an additional security measure that will help you locate your notebook if it is stolen.   The software is part of a service that runs on your Mac and when activated (via a website) notifies you of its location and periodically snaps photos of the person using it.   I use a competing product called <a href="http://www.orbicule.com/undercover/mac/">Undercover</a> which luckily I havenâ€™t needed to activate.</p>

<p>I think the best way to protect yourself is to protect your data.  Encrypt the contents of your hard disk, save offsite backups regularly, and when traveling, keep your notebook out of sight.<br/></p>
