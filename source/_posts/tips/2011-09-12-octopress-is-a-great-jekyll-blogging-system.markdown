I don't know how I missed this, but it appears that someone has taken [Jekyll] and packaged it with a great theme and a whole slew of plugins.  This package called [Octopress] is a fantastic static blogging package that in my opinion matches what you'd get with [Wordpress] straight out of the box.

I actually prefer the Octopress default theme to [Wordpress]'s.  A great side benefit to using [Octopress] is that it takes advantage of some of the newer more cutting edge technologies like [SASS] and [Compass].

It took me all of 10 minutes to migrate to Octopress.
