I'm in love with this keyboard.  Its the Microsoft Arc and it is   one of the most comfortable keyboards I've ever used.

The keyboard has great button action, is easy to position due to its small size, and works perfectly with my Mac and 2nd monitor.    It would be so cool if Apple embeded this sucker into the Mac Book Pro.  Pretty please?
