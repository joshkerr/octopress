I don't really know what to make of this.  Apparently this Russian guy is famous for shooting crazy guns.  This video received well over 1 million views so apparently he has quite a following.

So the dude just shoots this crazy gun that fires 4000 rounds per second.  The barrels of the gun get so hot that they turn red.  Not much else to see really except for his kid like attitude toward a weapon designed to take lives.  A lot of lives.
