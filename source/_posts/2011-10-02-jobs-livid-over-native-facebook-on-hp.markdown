<p>Yesterday Mashable had an <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/">article</a> on how Steve Jobs was furious with Facebook over building a client app for WebOS.   It went on to describe some of the earlier failures to work together:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Apple had fully integrated Facebook into the iPhone and iPad’s operating system, and was ready to launch the mobile-social fusion when API negotiations broke down. Apple, lacking confidence in Facebook’s ability to build a great application, asked to build its own Facebook for iPhone app. Facebook responded with a firm no. Negotiations came to halt.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Soon after, Facebook killed Apple’s access to the company’s API.   But why wouldn't Facebook let Apple build their API into the OS?  Seems like a win/win scenario for both companies.</p>
