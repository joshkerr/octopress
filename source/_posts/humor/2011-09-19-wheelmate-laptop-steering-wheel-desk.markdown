Amazon reviews are sometimes hilarious.  I recently found this gem for a Wheelmate laptop steering wheel desk.  You hook it on your steering wheel to give you a desk that you can use to write, type notes, etc..

Customers can upload their own product photos.  One customer uploaded this:

There are over 128 customer images of car crashes.  It is hilarious how an entire Amazon community of reviewers has decided that this product causes car accidents.  It probably does.
