<a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> is like crack cocaine but for blogging.  It sucks you in, addicts you and then leaves you craving more.  The problem is that like drugs, it isn't always around.  I've had more outages on Tumblr than any other hosted service with many outages lasting days.  I'm quitting my drug habit, see you later Tumblr.

Tumblr is great for setting up a quick nicely styled blog and it has a good selection of tools to create content.  I love how each post is split into a category, links, text, photos, etc..  All of that is good, but can be replicated on other blogging platforms.  For example, Wordpress.

Tumblr does not allow you to leave their service easily.  While they suck blog content into their service from their old blogs, they make it difficult to switch back.  I had to use a python script to scrape my content away and spent some considerable time editing it to make it work on Wordpress.

I wish I could take my Tumblr <a href="http://scaffold.tumblr.com/">theme</a> with me.  I contacted the artist who made it and he informed me that the rights to it are owned by Tumblr.  That theme is the only thing I'm going to miss.
