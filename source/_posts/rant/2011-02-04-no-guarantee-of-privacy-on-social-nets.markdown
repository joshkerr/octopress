There is no guarantee of privacy on social networks.  So when I read about leaks like the 250,000 [Stolen Facebook Profiles][] I'm not at all worried about someone breaking into my data.  I don't post photos that someone couldn't have taken themselves while I'm out in public.  There is no guarantee of privacy while you are in public, so a photo of your kids at the playground stolen off your Facebook isn't a big deal because someone could've just as easily snapped a photo of your kids while they were at the playground.

There is a certification called [SAS70][] which ensures that a company follows its own privacy and security policies.  People automatically assume that a SAS70 certified company has maximum security in place to prevent leaks, but the reality is that all SAS70 does it ensure that a company is following its own policies.  So if the company has a bad policy, there could be a leak, but they could still have a [SAS70][] certification.  So it is very important to read the privacy policy and terms of service before you start giving out your data.

At the end of the day, your data is probably at risk without you even knowing it.  So no matter how safe you think you are, some bank, restaurant, or online store could accidentally leak information about you.  I guess the best thing we can do is to develop a thick skin and pray.
