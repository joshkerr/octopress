I just finished watching a horrible YouTube video of the Bahrain military firing into an unarmed peaceful protest killing several people.  Looking at the date on the video, it was recorded only hours ago.  Technology is empowering people and over throwing governments.

It was only a few weeks ago that Egypt under similar circumstances found itself powerless to the force of viral media as protesters published hours of video to YouTube and Facebook.  The results saw the government toppled after decades of tyrannic rule.  

The power of the mob combined with the mobile phone & social media is a powerful combination.  (I was going to write more, but I got busy.  I know, lame.)
