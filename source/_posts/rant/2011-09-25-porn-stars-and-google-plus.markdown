![Bree Olson](http://f.cl.ly/items/090o1y460O0i0u1J4308/Screen%20Shot%202011-09-25%20at%2010.54.50%20AM.png)

I received an email notification last night from Google Plus that a person named Bree Olson had added me to one of her circles.  I don't know a person named Bree, the but woman in the profile picture was attractive.  I didn't think about it again until later that night when I browsed her profile and only then did I learn that she is a professional adult film star.

My first reaction was bemusement, why would she add me to her profile?  I've never met her before, I don't work in her industry, and it is doubtful that we follow the same people.  Then I got curious.  Who is she following?

The list of people that Bree follows is full of people strikingly similar to me.  Regular joes who seem to be entrepreneurs and love technology.  Why is Bree adding people like me to her Google Plus circles?  Thinking about this led me to realization that here I am writing a blog post about her.

Bree might be leveraging Google Plus to get the word out in a very modern social sort of way.  I was so curious about the fact that she added me that I inadvertently spread word about her.  She could be a marketing genius.  Leveraging the curiosity of strangers who follow you and the fact that she is an attractive woman, she's created a very inexpensive and powerful tool to get the word out about herself.

Porn star with marketing prowess.
