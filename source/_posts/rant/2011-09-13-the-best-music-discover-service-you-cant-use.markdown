I'm a big fan of [Turntable.fm] the music discovery service that lets you and your friends DJ rooms.  You can up or downvote the DJ and or the current song playing.  You can create rooms with certain music genres and decide whether to be a DJ or fan.  DJ's stand in line waiting for their turn.  You continue to spin records as long as the listeners in the room like your music.

The big neato factor for me is that it allows me to build playlists from currently playing songs. I can replay those songs and or link to them in iTunes, Spotify, or Amazon.

Its a great service, but its invite only.  I don't remember how I got invited, but I love it.
