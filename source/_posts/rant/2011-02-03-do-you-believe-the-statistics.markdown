excerpt: I love those charts spelling out crazy stats.  Are they accurate?

There are so many infographics that chart different types of stats over different industries.  The latest version I saw is on cellphone usage from [Brand Apps Today][] that looks a bit like this:

[![Mobile Phone Usage Chart][1]][1]

If you take a look at some of these numbers, they seem impossible to gather.  "Americans who answer the phone during sex?"  They did a survey on that?  Doubtful.

You really have to take these things with a grain of salt.  Make up your own mind on whether or not to believe the statistics.  Just because someone spouts a number, doesn't mean it is true.
