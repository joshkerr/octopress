The [La Times][] ran an article today covering the CA State Supreme Court's ruling that retailers in can no longer ask customers for Zip Codes when paying with a credit card.   Apparently the Zip Code is considered a personal piece of identification.  Seriously?  

There are probably over 10,000 people living in my Zip Code.  Its about as personal as a stadium full of people.  I think it is ridiculous and I hope that a higher court overturns.  Meanwhile, there are a dozen or so lawsuits against major retailers that are going to be impacted by this.  The ruling is supposed to protect customers from credit card fraud and identity theft.  I think stupidity will continue to be the main problem with fraud and theft.  This ruling isn't likely to help much.
