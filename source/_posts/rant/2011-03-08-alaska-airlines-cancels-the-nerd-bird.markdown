title: Alaska Airlines cancels the nerd bird

I'm a big fan of the Alaska Airlines flight from Austin to San Jose.  I take it regularly now that I'm working for YouSendIt and it has quickly become my favorite airline and flight.  There is Wifi on the plane and it works great through the Gogo service, the flight attendants are really great, and it is all reasonably priced.  Lastly, for some wonderful reason that I can't explain I get upgraded automatically to first class.

With all those great amenities, you could understand why I'm upset to hear that they've cancelled the service between Austin and San Jose.  Their official word is that they want to focus more on the Northwest region but I think it has more to do with competition from the newly announced Southwest Airlines service.  Just when I started to get real comfortable they go and shut it down.  I'm not happy.
