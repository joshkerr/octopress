Microsoft kicked off its build conference today (this is their developer conference) and demoed the much anticipated Windows 8.

Windows 8 is supposed to be Microsoft's answer to Apple's Lion/iOS combo.  It is going to be their Tablet and PC OS allowing you to use a touch interface or a full app interface.  This is where I think Microsoft nailed it.  Anything you can do in the full Windows OS interface you can do with their new Metro touch interface.  

Microsoft also showed off their new runtime libraries which allow you to write apps in web technologies.  Javascript, CSS, HTML5, etc..  This is an amazing feat and one that should level the field between Apple and all the other tablet competitors.  

I think they hit it out of the park today.  What they announced is pretty fantastic and if they can deliver on it and quickly, they might give PC makers the shot they've been looking for in going after Apple.  I just don't see how Android will be able to compete a year from now.
