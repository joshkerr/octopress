title: Twitter, did you just change your icon again?
category: rant
excerpt:

Why would you change your icon again? The Mac App Store launches, Twitter launches a new client with a black Icon. It looked cool. Then they released an update with a blue icon. Now a third update with a 3d icon. Why? Just focus on making your app less annoying.

A normal Mac App has the minimize, maximize and close icons at the top right in standard red, yellow and green.

Twitter decided to write their own UI with black icons. While it might look good, it isn't that easy to use. Why not keep the standard OS UI?

I'm done with my rant now.
