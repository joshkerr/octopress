title: Google docs in real time?  Google Wave?

Google Docs probably received some of the technology from the now [abandoned][] [Google Wave][], because I just signed up on a Google Docs spreadsheet and while I was filling it in, I could see other users in [real time][] adding their data.  It was really creepy at first, but then really interesting.  I actually sat around and watched others move the cursor around the spreadsheet, type in their data, it was very voyeur like.

Now I know where [Google Wave][] went.  Nicely done Google.
