*Self portrait of me and my son.  Note that my son is picking his nose.*

I'm a technology enthusiast and entrepreneur living in Austin, TX with my girlfriend [Stefania][] and two children.  I'm big into music, photography, cars and outdoor activities.

### Current Work

I have been building technologies to help empower consumers for over a decade. I'm a software developer turned entrepreneur and am currently working at Macheen as their Director of Product Management.  Over the past five years I've specialized in developing mobile products with much of my work on Apple's iOS platform.

I am also a mentor at [Capital Factory][] an early stage startup accelerator in Austin.

### Earlier Work

Prior to Macheen, I worked for YouSendIt, a company that acquired my startup Zosh in December 2010. I led product management for their mobile products and in six months delivered a successful product to market which became the highlight of a multi-product launch.

Before YouSendIt I worked at Zosh a startup I co-founded that lets you fill, sign and return documents as PDF's via your mobile phone.  I launched the product at DEMO Spring 2010 where I won a DEMOgod award for my presentation which included smashing a fax machine with a baseball bat.

Prior to Zosh I was CEO of Ideal Science a software company I founded in early 1998 which developed scalable Bulletin Board software used by Microsoft on their xBox gaming properties (most famously Bungie Studios which produced Halo, Halo2 and Halo3.)  Other notable customers include Hachette Filipacchi Media, CNN, and the FBI.

Before Ideal Science, I worked as a software engineer at Compaq Computer Corporation. I was in charge of developing test software for controller chips in notebook computers as well as training the engineers who used my software.

I attended the University of Texas at Austin where I received a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.

### Blog Details

I'm using [Jekyll][] to generate this blog.  Hosting is by [Heroku][] which I recently [switched][] to.  I'm also using [Redis][] as a temp data store for my feed data and [Ohm][] for inserting objects into the Redis key store.  

Lastly I'm using [Feedzirra][] to retrieve and parse my RSS feeds.  All of this is open source software which is state of the art and can scale pretty easily.  (Not that I'll ever get that kind of traffic to this blog.)

I've only recently started working with these technologies, so the blog could be a bit wonky.

### Update

I'm still using [Jekyll] to power the blog, but the site is now totally static.  I'm grabbing my Delicious feeds and Embedly links at compile time to generate what appears to be dynamic content, but is actually just generated static content.

I've been able to accelerate my site using [Cloud Flare][] a really cool service that sits between my site and the Internet.  In addition to security, [Cloud Flare] also adds features and performance.  For example, if you highlight any word on the site, you get a special lookup that tells you more about that word.

Powered by [Octopress] a static blogging package built around [Jekyll] and running on [Heroku].
