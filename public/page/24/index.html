  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tyler Hall, a web guy over at Yahoo wrote this great script that will automatically sort through your Amazon S3 stored images and run them through Yahoo&#8217;s autosmash to optimize them for faster web performance.</p>


<p>Why should this concern you?  First, you should not be hosting your blog&#8217;;s images from your blog web site.  You should be using a CDN (content delivery network) just in case you get a front page link on the New York Times or Reddit which would cause thousands of users to suddenly come visit your site.  Hosting those images from your site would kill your site.  (Think denial of service.)</p>


<p>If you are using Wordpress you should also be using TanTan Noodles Amazon S3<a href="http://tantannoodles.com/toolkit/wordpress-s3/">plugin</a>.  This plugin will automatically place uploaded images on your in your S3 account.  Amazon is a low cost CDN and this plugin makes its use seamless.</p>


<p>Now add in Autosmush and you can have your photos optimized not only in size (without loss of quality,) but to last in your browsers cache for a longer period of time.  So rather than requesting the same image over and over, it will grab the image from its cache thus cutting back on a lot of the requests to your server.</p>


<p>Everything you need to install and use this script is available on Tyler&#8217;;s github account.  I&#8217;;ve been using it for a month now and it works great.</p>

      <p class="meta">

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is no question that you want your data backed up to the cloud and the cheapest way to do that is by using Amazon S3.  For more people, their hosted servers provide some sort of web based automated backup system.  For those of us that manage our own servers, yo&#8217;ll need to configure something yourself.  This task can be fairly straight forward and I&#8217;ll show you how I&#8217;ve configured mine.</p>

<p>The key tool that we are going to use is a program called duplicity which will support incremental encrypted backups to Amazon.  Before we get started yo&#8217;ll need an Amazon S3 account with a bucket configured for your backups.  I&#8217;m not going to show you how to do that in this article as it is pretty straight forward.</p>

<p>Next, you&#8217;ll want to choose which directories on your server you want to backup.  For me, I&#8217;m backing up the following</p>

<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='bash'>/home/
/etc/
/usr/
/lib/
/opt/
/root/
/var/</code>
  </pre>
</div>


<p>This gives me all that I&#8217;d need to reconfigure my server in case of complete server failure.  It isn&#8217;t a complete drive clone, but I don&#8217;t really need that.</p>

<p>To install duplicity, you&#8217;ll need to make sure that your apt-get library is up to date.</p>

<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='bash'>apt-get update</code>
  </pre>
</div>


<p>Next you&#8217;ll want to install duplicity:</p>

<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='bash'>apt-get install duplicity</code>
  </pre>
</div>


<p>With duplicity installed, all that is left is your backup script.  You probably shouldn&#8217;t leave the PASSPHRASE in the script and you will need to replace they [KEY-ID] and [SEC-KEY] with your own Amazon information.  Here is a copy of mine:</p>

<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='bash'>#!/bin/bash

#Log script
log() { logger -t scriptname &quot;$@&quot;; echo &quot;$@&quot;; }

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=[KEY-ID]
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=[SEC-KEY]
export PASSPHRASE=[PASSWORD]

duplicity /home/ s3+http://joshkerr/joshkerr-com/home/
duplicity /etc/ s3+http://joshkerr/joshkerr-com/etc/
duplicity /usr/ s3+http://joshkerr/joshkerr-com/usr/
duplicity /lib/ s3+http://joshkerr/joshkerr-com/lib/
duplicity /opt/ s3+http://joshkerr/joshkerr-com/opt/
duplicity /root/ s3+http://joshkerr/joshkerr-com/root/
duplicity /var/ s3+http://joshkerr/joshkerr-com/var/

log &quot;Backup completed.&quot;

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
export PASSPHRASE</code>
  </pre>
</div>


<p>Its a good thing I posted this article shortly before I decided to upgrade my server to Ubuntu 10.04 LTS because it basically wiped clean my drive.  Hey MediaTemple, where is the heads up?  They do put your old data in the /old folder, but it was way easier to restore from Amazon S3.  Thank you duplicity.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://mailgun.net/">Mailgun</a> is a service that provides a web-server API for fully managed, scalable email servers.  This is something that I think would work great with a service like <a href="http://www.zosh.com">Zosh</a>.</p>


<p>If you run a web application that needs to process email, the best way to get that email into your app server would be to have it posted.  You provide some sort of secure page and emails are posted via an HTTP POST.  Sendmail will let you do this, but there aren&#8217;t a lot of other email servers that have this kind of capability.  This is where Mailgun comes in.  They will post a UTF-8 format email to the URL that you specify.  You get all parts of the email including the attachments and you can process it as if it was ordinary data.  You can even apply pattern matching before the email reaches your app server.</p>


<p>This is very powerful as it can be used to setup routes for certain emails.  For example lets say that we want to assign each user on our system their own @joshkerr.com email address.  Using this system we can easily route all shipping@joshkerr.com emails to a different location than the invoicing@joshkerr.com emails.</p>




<p>Mailgun provides a host of libraries to get you started including Ruby, PHP, Python, Java and C#.  <a href="http://mailgun.net/pricing">Pricing</a> is reasonable and I&#8217;m really tempted to use their service for one of my projects.  If anyone has any experience with them, please post to the comments.</p>




<p>Here is some sample code showing an HTTP POST:</p>




<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='ruby'>def upload(request):
     if request.method == 'POST':
         sender    = request.POST.get('sender')
         recipient = request.POST.get('recipient')
         subject   = request.POST.get('subject', '')

         body_html  = request.POST.get('body-html', '')
         body_plain = request.POST.get('body-plain', '')

         for key in request.FILES:
             file = request.FILES[key]
             # do_something_cool_with(file)

     # Returned text is ignored but HTTP status code matters:
     # Mailgun wants to see 200, otherwise it will make another attempt
     return HttpResponse('OK')</code>
  </pre>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>PageLines is a premium Wordpress theme maker and they just recently released their <a href="http://www.pagelines.com/demos/platformpro/">PlatformPro</a> theme which is more like a drag and drop content management system for Wordpress than it is a theme.  I&#8217;m using it now on joshkerr.com and the more I dig into it, the more impressed I am with its capabilities to produce a stunning website.  What separates PlatformPro from other standard wordpress themes is the amount of customization that you can perform from the Wordpress admin section.</p>




<p>The theme itself isn&#8217;t so much a theme, but a whole layer of user interface controls which can be easily manipulated via a very simple control panel.  This powerful functionality allows you to take a simple Wordpress blog and add features like: </p>




<p>Universal sidebars, carousels, <a href="http://www.pagelines.com/demos/platformpro/features">feature boxes</a> and much more.  I can&#8217;t stress how easy it is to put together and manage a very powerful and professional looking website with PlatformPro.  Now while all of this sounds great, the PlatformPro product is fairly new and there are a few bugs here and there.  The people at PageLines have been quick to fix them with new releases and upgrading your installation is pretty easy using the built in theme upgrade functionality within Wordpress 3.  I&#8217;m using PlatformPro on several websites now and I&#8217;m pretty happy with it.  For more information check out the <a href="http://www.pagelines.com/">PageLines web site</a>.  It costs $95 and requires Wordpress 3.0 and above with PHP version 5 and above.</p>

<p>It turns out that I had several images both horizontal and vertical sitting in that folder and OSX uses some kind of formula to generate an icon showing you the contents of the folder.  In my case it just ended up being a cross.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Many startups begin with two or more co-founders.  Each co-founder brings a different set of skills to the table and it is critical that each co-founder’s role is clearly defined and that you set agreeable goals otherwise your startup is doom to fail. </p>




<p>Right from the beginning, each co-founder will wear different hats.  Some will be responsible for development, some for marketing, some for business development and others for investor relations.  These areas of responsibility should be placed into clearly defined roles with attached goals. <br/><br/></p>




<h2>What role will you play in your new startup?</h2>




<p><br/><br/>For example let’s say we define the role of marketing to include public relations and social network out reach.  The goal for the first three months could be to establish a social marketing presence and attain 600 twitter followers and 1000 views to the company’s website.  This marketing role now has a goal and can be assigned to one of the co-founders. <br/><br/>Each role should be assigned to the person with the best chance for success.  At the end of the first month the group should review the performance of each person and decide on whether the roles need to be changed, goals need to be adjusted or if that person needs to be removed all together from their assigned role. <br/><br/>Consider this comment by Bob, a co-founder who was assigned with the aforementioned marking role:</p>




<blockquote>Hey it wasn&#8217;t my fault that we only got 230 twitter followers even though our goal was 600.  John didn&#8217;t do enough Tweeting.</blockquote>




<p><br/>Actually, it was your fault that you only received 230 twitter followers.  You own the marketing role.  You should&#8217;ve done everything in your power to make sure that you hit your numbers.  If John isn&#8217;t helping, find someone else who will or do it yourself. <br/><br/>The other key element to roles is delineating clear authority with regard to decision making.   The co-founders should decide the extent to which each persons role can make decisions without needing the permission from the group.  This is paramount as it will facilitate much faster iteration.  Every time the co-founders need to meet to make a decision, they waste time so allowing Bob the authority to run a promotion to acquire more twitter users could&#8217;ve allowed him to hit his goal. <br/><br/>With this formula in place, the company will have its best chance for success.  It will also place clear responsibility, ownership, and authority with each of the co-founders and provide a good way to reward future success or punish failure.</p>
