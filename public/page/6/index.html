  <div class="entry-content"><blockquote>
iCloud&#8217;s web access is a marginal upgrade from Mobile Me.  Nothing earth shattering here.</blockquote>

<p>
Apple’s new iCloud Web apps are built using the same SproutCore Javascript engine that was used throughout MobileMe.  If the favicon above doesn’t prove it, looking at the underlying code below seems to offer undeniable evidence.
SproutCore describes itself as an open-source framework for building blazingly fast, innovative user experiences on the web.</p>
<p>
Here’s a nice interview with Charles Jolley, one of the founders of SproutCore and previous head of MobileMe Javascript Frameworks Manager.  He left Apple about a year ago to start Strobe – a device agnostic Web publishing engine based on…you guessed it, SproutCore.
Interestingly, SproutCore lists Strobe Inc. as its parent company.</p>

<p>Amazing test drive of the 2012 Bentley Continental GT</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we <a href="http://gearpatrol.com/blog/2011/07/14/preview-something-bentley-this-way-comes/">mentioned</a>, earlier this summer GP got the chance to dive into the fabled world of <a href="http://www.bentleymotors.com/">Bentley Motors</a>. Immersing ourselves in a century’s worth of motoring history the marquee boasts, we took an in-depth look at everything from Bentley’s bespoke coachbuilding process to an all-access look at Bentley’s factory grounds. And of course, time <a href="http://gearpatrol.com/blog/category/vehicles/behind-the-wheel/">behind the wheel</a> in the devastatingly handsome <a href="http://www.bentleymotors.com/models/new_continental_gt/">2012 Continental GT</a>.</p>
<p>We’ll be bringing this to you over a series of several posts, but it’s Wednesday so why not start with dessert: a photo essay. Dive in right after the jump.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Monster Cable has a history of suing competitors that infringe on their patents.  Usually the competitor fearing an expensive trial, obtains and a license from Monster and moves on.</p>
<p>This is decidely not what happened when Monster <a href="http://www.audioholics.com/news/industry-news/monster-sues-blue-jeans-cable">sued</a> <a href="http://www.bluejeanscable.com/">Blue Jeans Cables</a>.  Nope.  You see Blue Jean&#8217;s President is actually a former litigation attorney and his <a href="http://www.audioholics.com/news/industry-news/blue-jeans-strikes-back">response</a> to Monster recently made public is legendary.</p>
<p>He puts a huge burden on Monster to demonstrate the infringement, asks for documents from all successful patent filings, cases, etc..</p>
<p>Then, he asks for all documents relating to Monster&#8217;s offshore tax haven:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.75em; margin-left: 0px; line-height: 1.5em;"><em>I assume that Monster Cable International, Ltd., in Bermuda, listed on these patents, is an IP holding company and that Monster Cable&#8217;s principal US entity pays licensing fees to the Bermuda corporation in order to shift income out of the United States and thereby avoid paying United States federal income tax on those portions of its income; my request for these licensing agreements is specifically intended to include any licensing agreements, including those with closely related or sham entities, within or without the Monster Cable &#8220;family,&#8221; and without regard to whether those licensing agreements are sham transactions for tax shelter purposes only or whether they are </em><em>bona fide arm&#8217;s-length transactions.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally he ends talking about about his career in law:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1985, I spent nineteen years in litigation practice, with a focus upon federal litigation involving large damages and complex issues.  My first seven years were spent primarily on the defense side, where I developed an intense frustration with insurance carriers who would settle meritless claims for nuisance value when the better long-term view would have been to fight against vexatious litigation as a matter of principle.  In plaintiffs&#8217; practice, likewise, I was always a strong advocate of standing upon principle and taking cases all the way to judgment, even when substantial offers of settlement were on the table.  I am &#8220;uncompromising&#8221; in the most literal sense of the word.  If Monster Cable proceeds with litigation against me I will pursue the same merits-driven approach; I do not compromise with bullies and I would rather spend fifty thousand dollars on defense than give you a dollar of unmerited settlement funds.  As for signing a licensing agreement for intellectual property which I have not infringed: that will not happen, under any circumstances, whether it makes economic sense or not.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Monster should stay away from this one at all costs.</p>

<p><em>Even though the above image frightens my heart at first sight (Naoto Tajima of Japan, Jesse Owens of the USA, Luz Long of Nazi Germany) the story behind the nr. 1 and the nr. 2 of the 1936 Olympic long jump finalists touches my heart very much.</em></p>




<p>Carl Ludwig Luz Long (far right) was a German sprinter and long-jumper who finished second to Jesse Owens in the <a href="http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&amp;OLGY=1936">Berlin Olympic Games of 1936</a>.</p>




<p>Long was born in Leipzig, Germany in 1913.</p>




<p>By  the time the great black American sprinter Jesse Owens arrived in  Berlin in the summer of 1936, little worried him &hellip; except Long who was  German and the reigning European long-jump champion.</p>




<p>But as Adolf Hitler and 100,000 spectators watched, Long went right up and shook the black  American&rsquo;s hand. He thus befriended the great American athlete and did  not shy from reaching out even though his own government was promoting a  white Aryan race policy which would soon slip into genocide.</p>




<p>Long  helped Owens at the long-jump trials, when Owens was so spooked by  European rules that he almost failed to qualify, even while Long posted  an Olympic record, (soon to be smashed by Owens in the final). In the  finals, Long finished second to Owens, and took home Olympic silver.  When they stood on the podium to receive their medals, Long, standing  behind Owens, and made the <em>de rigeur</em> Nazi salute.</p>




<p>Owens  was delighted as he knew that Long was the German opposition and was not  expecting such a charming friend. One night, Long found Owens in the  Olympic Village and they had a long private talk, resulting in a long  friendship.</p>




<p>Luz continued to compete in track meets achieving his personal best of 7.90 meters in the long jump in 1937.</p>




<p>Luz  finished law school at the University of Leipzig and briefly practiced  in Hamburg. But inevitably, when the war turned against Germany, all  healthy men were drafted and he became a Nazi soldier. He wrote Owens a  final letter in 1942, just after the United States declared war on  Germany:</p>




<blockquote><em>&ldquo;My heart is telling me that this is perhaps the last  letter of my life. If that is so, I beg one thing from you. When the war  is over, please go to Germany, find my son and tell him about his  father. Tell him about the times when war did not separate us and tell  him that things can be different between men in this world.<br /></em>

<p><em>&ldquo;Your brother, Luz.&rdquo;</em></p>

</blockquote>




<p>Luz  Long was injured on July 10, 1943 when the Allies invaded Sicily. In a  British field hospital, he died on July 13, 1943. He was only 30 and was  buried in the war cemetery of Motta Sant&rsquo;Anastasia, in Sicily.</p>




<p>In  1951, Jesse Owens kept his promise and found Long&rsquo;s son in war-torn  German. He later said that what he valued the most from Olympic  experience had been his friendship with Luz Long.</p>


<p></blockquote></p>
