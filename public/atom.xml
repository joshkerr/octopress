    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is really cool:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Angry Birds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, the game I’m going to be making is to be based on the extremely popular Angry Birds by Rovio, a AAA title &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.develop-online.net/news/37242/Angry-Birds-cost-Rovio-100k-has-made-50m&quot;&gt;which cost some $140k USD to make&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wildbunny.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/screenShot.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;screenShot&quot; src=&quot;http://www.wildbunny.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/screenShot.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; height=&quot;375&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angry Birds&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, since its just me making this I will have to take a few short-cuts and will be concentrating on the core part of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cloning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I start I should mention that I do not condone the cloning of games in any way; what I’m doing in these tutorials is purely for educational purposes and I have no plans to release the game at the end of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, lets have a look at the requirements for a bare-bones version of the game:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Graphics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Background, mid-ground and foreground layers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bird characters,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pig characters,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Slingshot,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rigid body pieces – materials: wood, stone, glass in rectangle, square and triangle shapes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Camera&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Panning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parallax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zoom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Object tracking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collision detection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Possible requirement for advanced broad-phase&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Various static and dynamic shapes – rectangles, triangles, circles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Object colliding call-back system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very stable physics engine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrated object sleeping system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Editor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some kind of editor to allow layout of levels and creation of graphics. I’m using Flash CS4 for all this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Beginning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing I’m going to tackle from that list is to get the world set up so that there is a nice looking environment and to root the project in something solid looking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started with the podium that the birds gets launched from; its going to be a static object in the physics system and to keep things simple I’m going to compose all objects from primitive parts, so collision wise at least the podium will be made from some squares and triangles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wildbunny.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/podium.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;podium&quot; src=&quot;http://www.wildbunny.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/podium.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;224&quot; height=&quot;64&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podium&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, it’s covered with a repeating earth texture, so the first thing is to make this. Its actually quite easy to do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wildbunny.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/repeatingEarth.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;repeatingEarth&quot; src=&quot;http://www.wildbunny.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/repeatingEarth.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Process&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first part is easy, just pick two vaguely earthy colours and paint one half of the texture in each colour, with a nice rough overlap in the midddle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, offset the image by half the width and height (I used photoshop’s offset filter) to get the image in the middle. Then you can rough up the middle edge as you did in the first image. Once you’re done you’ll have a nice infinitely repeatable texture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to actually apply this texture to an arbitrary object in Flash, you import the image onto the stage, then right click and and choose ‘Break apart’. Then you can use the eye-dropper tool to pick that texture as a fill texture which you can then apply to any shape with the paint bucket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wildbunny.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/repeatDemo.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;repeatDemo&quot; src=&quot;http://www.wildbunny.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/repeatDemo.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;153&quot; height=&quot;120&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infinite repeats&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because we’re making all collision objects from primitive shapes, we need to decide what basic shapes we’re going to be using. I chose these for the podium:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wildbunny.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/podiumShapes.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;podiumShapes&quot; src=&quot;http://www.wildbunny.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/podiumShapes.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;179&quot; height=&quot;68&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podium shapes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These can be rotated, duplicated and placed to form the podium shape:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wildbunny.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/podiumShapesComposed.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;podiumShapesComposed&quot; src=&quot;http://www.wildbunny.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/podiumShapesComposed.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;242&quot; height=&quot;71&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Podium composed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, when actually creating the shape for the visible part of the podium, its important to follow the exact same shape that you could compose only using the primitive collision shapes in various different configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will start to become very useful later when we try to integrate the physics system with the graphics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Foreground&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foreground consists of another tiling shape; the soil. This was made from a rectangle, and lots of ovals in Flash, just repeated and placed. Its important to make sure it tiles so pay attention at the edges and use grid snap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wildbunny.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/foreground.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;foreground&quot; src=&quot;http://www.wildbunny.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/foreground.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;224&quot; height=&quot;50&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreground&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mid-ground&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet another tiling shape, this time rolling hills with a few far off plants; nothing out of the ordinary here, just make sure it tiles. You’ll want to make this one wider than the screen – I made mine roughly twice as wide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wildbunny.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/midground.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;midground&quot; src=&quot;http://www.wildbunny.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/midground-300x50.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;50&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mid-ground&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you guessed it, tiling shapes again – this one is roughly one screen in size:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wildbunny.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/background.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;background&quot; src=&quot;http://www.wildbunny.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/background-300x217.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;217&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Background&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exporting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these layers have been set to export for action-script in the Flash IDE; I’ve appended every name with &lt;em&gt;Fla &lt;/em&gt;so that I can tell in code which classes are from Flash and which are my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything should now be exported as a .swc which you can enable in File-&amp;gt;Publish Settings-&amp;gt;Flash-&amp;gt;Export SWC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you can import this SWC into your project in your favourite flash code compiler; I’m using &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sapphiresteel.com/Products/amethyst-ide/article/amethyst-product-page&quot;&gt;Amythyst&lt;/a&gt; because I cannot live without Visual Studio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Putting it together&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, the idea with all these separate layers is that the code will place and animate them separately to give a parallax effect as the camera pans/zooms around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dimensions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I picked a screen size of 640×360 (wide-screen), and a world size of 2560×720 (four screens wide by two screens high). And I’ve centred the world at 0,0.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a good camera class is fundamental to any game, particularly this one which requires lots of smooth pans and zooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very least it should provide functions for converting coordinates between world space and screen space and visa versa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because there are three layers of parallax at work, the camera needs to be able to position each one as it pans around the scene, so its constructor takes them as parameters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Camera&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;background&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span&gt;MovieClip&lt;/span&gt;, midground:&lt;span&gt;MovieClip&lt;/span&gt;, foreground:&lt;span&gt;MovieClip&lt;/span&gt;, bird:Bird&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&#8230;
&lt;span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bird parameter is just a dummy at the moment which represents the focal point for the camera – it contains accessors for position so the camera can know where in the world it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to get the camera to centre on the bird no matter where the bird is on screen we need to do a little bit of maths; forming what is known as the &lt;em&gt;world to screen&lt;/em&gt; matrix, so called because it transforms points in world space into screen space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; Update&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; dt:&lt;span&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; : &lt;span&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    m_worldToScreen = &lt;span&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; Matrix&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;
 
    m_worldToScreen.&lt;span&gt;translate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; -m_bird.&lt;span&gt;m_Pos&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;, -m_bird.&lt;span&gt;m_Pos&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span&gt;m_y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;
    m_worldToScreen.&lt;span&gt;scale&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; m_scale.&lt;span&gt;m_x&lt;/span&gt;, m_scale.&lt;span&gt;m_y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;
    m_worldToScreen.&lt;span&gt;translate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; Constants.&lt;span&gt;kScreenDimensions&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span&gt;m_x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;, Constants.&lt;span&gt;kScreenDimensions&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span&gt;m_y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;
 
    m_foreground.&lt;span&gt;transform&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span&gt;matrix&lt;/span&gt; = m_worldToScreen;
 
    &lt;span&gt;// for screen-&amp;gt;world matrix&lt;/span&gt;
    m_screenToWorld = m_worldToScreen.&lt;span&gt;clone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;
    m_screenToWorld.&lt;span&gt;invert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s going on in the above function is: first the camera is centred on the bird, then any zoom is applied and finally we add on the centre of the screen to make sure the bird is in the centre (remember, 0,0 is the top left of the screen, not the centre).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We then take this matrix and apply it as the transform for the foreground geometry, so in actual fact &lt;strong&gt;the geometry moves around the camera&lt;/strong&gt;, not the other way around – which is a bit difficult to get your head around at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first translate in the above snippet is easier to understand with this in mind – 0,0 is the destination for the world geometry, coming from the position of the bird and &lt;em&gt;0-m_bird.m_Pos&lt;/em&gt; is the vector which achieves that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I take a copy of this matrix and invert it so that I can do the opposite transform whenever I need to convert a point in screen-space to world-space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get the parallax effect on the back and mid-ground layers, I do a similar piece of maths for each layer (each layer getting its own world-&amp;gt;screen matrix), the only change is that I divide the x translation by the layer’s z-depth, which causes them to move at different speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this will work fine, but it won’t prevent the camera from leaving the bounds of the world. In order to do that we need to understand the camera’s relationship with the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, lets take a look at the world, the camera and their relationship:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wildbunny.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/figure1.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;figure1&quot; src=&quot;http://www.wildbunny.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/figure1.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;585&quot; height=&quot;201&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1&lt;/em&gt; shows the entire extents of the world and also one possible location for the camera. Note that the camera has the dimensions of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this configuration, the camera is actually showing a view which is partially outside the world, which should not be allowed to happen. In order to fix this problem we need to know exactly how far outside the camera is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wildbunny.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/figure2.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;figure2&quot; src=&quot;http://www.wildbunny.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/figure2.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;586&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Figure 2 shows the measurements we need to correct this problem (the red arrows) and also shows in green, the camera’s position after it has been corrected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; Update&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; dt:&lt;span&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; : &lt;span&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;// clamp camera to only show map&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;//&lt;/span&gt;
 
    &lt;span&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; translate:Vector2 = m_bird.&lt;span&gt;m_Pos&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span&gt;m_Neg&lt;/span&gt;;
 
    &lt;span&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; screenHalfExtents:Vector2 = &lt;span&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; Vector2&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Constants.&lt;span&gt;kScreenDimensions&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span&gt;m_x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;, Constants.&lt;span&gt;kScreenDimensions&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span&gt;m_y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span&gt;Div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; Vector2&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;m_scale.&lt;span&gt;m_x&lt;/span&gt;, m_scale.&lt;span&gt;m_y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; mapExtents:Vector2 = Constants.&lt;span&gt;kWorldAabb&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span&gt;m_HalfExtents&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span&gt;MulScalar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;
 
    &lt;span&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; topLeft:Vector2 = m_bird.&lt;span&gt;m_Pos&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span&gt;Sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;screenHalfExtents&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; bottomRight:Vector2 = m_bird.&lt;span&gt;m_Pos&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span&gt;Add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;screenHalfExtents&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;
 
    &lt;span&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; correctLeft:&lt;span&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span&gt;min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;topLeft.&lt;span&gt;m_x&lt;/span&gt;+Constants.&lt;span&gt;kWorldAabb&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span&gt;m_HalfExtents&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span&gt;m_x&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; correctTop:&lt;span&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span&gt;min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;topLeft.&lt;span&gt;m_y&lt;/span&gt;+Constants.&lt;span&gt;kWorldAabb&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span&gt;m_HalfExtents&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span&gt;m_y&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;
 
    &lt;span&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; correctRight:&lt;span&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span&gt;min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Constants.&lt;span&gt;kWorldAabb&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span&gt;m_HalfExtents&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span&gt;m_x&lt;/span&gt;-bottomRight.&lt;span&gt;m_x&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; correctBottom:&lt;span&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span&gt;Math&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span&gt;min&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Constants.&lt;span&gt;kWorldAabb&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span&gt;m_HalfExtents&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span&gt;m_y&lt;/span&gt;-bottomRight.&lt;span&gt;m_y&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;
 
    translate.&lt;span&gt;m_x&lt;/span&gt; += correctLeft - correctRight;
    translate.&lt;span&gt;m_y&lt;/span&gt; += correctTop - correctBottom;
 
        &#8230;
&lt;span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above is the code which calculates the red arrowed regions shown in Figure 2, and applies any corrections needed to the initial translation of the camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is one caveat to watch out for: the foreground layer is a child of the main MovieClip which makes up the game – this is essential because otherwise the camera would only be translating the foreground shape and not everything in the world, which would be all bad. However, because the camera is translating the main MovieClip, the mid and background layers cannot be children of it. Instead, they must be children of the &lt;strong&gt;stage&lt;/strong&gt;; this allows them to be translated independently to give the correct effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Create a tile strip&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is relatively simple, you just divide the width of the world by the width of a tile to get the number of repetitions, set the starting point and then just instance the correct MovieClip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;private&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; CreateTileStrip&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;:Vector2, &lt;span&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span&gt;Class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span&gt;MovieClip&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; obj:&lt;span&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; mc:&lt;span&gt;MovieClip&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span&gt;MovieClip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; obj &lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; tileRoot:&lt;span&gt;MovieClip&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;MovieClip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;
 
    &lt;span&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; worldWidth:&lt;span&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt; = Constants.&lt;span&gt;kWorldAabb&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span&gt;m_HalfExtents&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span&gt;m_x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; numTiles:&lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;worldWidth&lt;span&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;mc.&lt;span&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; + &lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;;
 
    &lt;span&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; i:&lt;span&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;; i&lt;span&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;numTiles; i++&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; x:&lt;span&gt;Number&lt;/span&gt; = i&lt;span&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;mc.&lt;span&gt;width&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;
 
        mc.&lt;span&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; = x + &lt;span&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span&gt;m_x&lt;/span&gt;;
        mc.&lt;span&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span&gt;start&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;span&gt;m_y&lt;/span&gt;-mc.&lt;span&gt;height&lt;/span&gt;;
 
        tileRoot.&lt;span&gt;addChild&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; mc &lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;
 
        obj = &lt;span&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;
        mc = &lt;span&gt;MovieClip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; obj &lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;
    &lt;span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
 
    &lt;span&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; tileRoot;
&lt;span&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And you call it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;m_backgroundLayer = CreateTileStrip&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; bottomLeft, BackgroundTileFla &lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;
m_midgroundLayer = CreateTileStrip&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; bottomLeft, MidgroundTileFla &lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;
m_foregroundLayer = CreateTileStrip&lt;span&gt;(&lt;/span&gt; bottomLeft, ForegroundTileFla &lt;span&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was actually pleasantly surprised how easy it was to pass a class as a type in actionscript, much easier than in c# or c++ and it really makes it simple to tile any shape that you export from the Flash IDE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The iPhone 4S is super fast, runs iOS 5 which is chock full of goodness and comes with Siri which is arguably the best thing about it.&amp;nbsp; It is marketed as a personal assistant in your pocket.&amp;nbsp; For me, Siri is the Austin startup that was purchased last year and had an app in the App Store that had some potential but did not live up to its billing.&amp;nbsp; After spending a day with Siri on the iPhone 4S I’m walking away with a completely different view.&amp;nbsp; Siri really is a personal assistant in your pocket.&amp;nbsp; You talk to it as if you were dictating instructions to a person.&amp;nbsp; It amazingly has the ability to recognize keywords and translate them into actual tasks.&amp;nbsp; It works great and opens the door to a whole new category of computing driven by voice.&amp;nbsp; Apple has integrated Siri into its own apps, but it remains unclear if they plan to enable an API to allow third party developers to tap into its power.&amp;nbsp; If they know what is good for them, they will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not sure if I believe this story, but if it is true, it is sad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most pancreatic cancers are aggressive and always terminal, but Steve was lucky (if you can call it that) and had a rare form called an islet cell neuroendocrine tumor, which is actually quite treatable with excellent survival rates — if caught soon enough. The median survival is about a decade, but it depends on how soon it’s removed surgically. Steve caught his very early, and should have expected to survive much longer than a decade. Unfortunately Steve relied on a naturopathic diet instead of early surgery. There is no evidence that diet has any effect on islet cell carcinoma. &lt;a href=&quot;http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2008/06/13/steve-jobs-life-after-the-whipple/&quot;&gt;As he dieted for nine months&lt;/a&gt;, the tumor progressed, and took him from the high end to the low end of the survival rate.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Italy&#8217;s insane Internet law prompts removal of Italian Wikipedia</title>

    <id>http://joshkerr.com/2011/10/italy-insane-law-prevents-wikis</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;It is pretty insane that all one has to do to get a website to remove content is complain that the content is hurting their image.  Whether true or not and without any sort of third party discussion, the website has 48 hours to remove the offending content.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This law is going to seriously limit free speech in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/boingboing/iBag/~3/_pqODwqxMcI/italys-insane-internet-law-prompts-removal-of-italian-wikipedia.html&quot;&gt;Italy&amp;#8217;s insane Internet law prompts removal of Italian Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This proposal, which the Italian Parliament is currently debating, provides, among other things, a requirement to all websites to publish, within 48 hours of the request and without any comment, a correction of any content that the applicant deems detrimental to his/her image.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon adds server-side encryption to S3 data service</title>

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up until now, Amazon Web Services customers had three choices when it came to protecting data sitting in Amazon Simple Storage Service &amp;#8220;buckets&amp;#8221;: implementing &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/s3/AmazonS3EncryptionClient.html&quot;&gt;AWS&amp;#8217;s S3 Encryption Client&lt;/a&gt; or their own encryption in  application code; encrypting it locally with another application before uploading; or counting on AWS authentication to keep bad people out of their data. The first two ways can create bottlenecks when it comes to getting data in and out of applications to users, and the third is just plain stupid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there&amp;#8217;s another choice. Amazon has implemented &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/index.html?UsingEncryption.html&quot;&gt;server-side encryption &lt;/a&gt;of data using 256-bit AES crypto as part of the AWS REST, Java, and .NET APIs for S3, and as an option for data uploaded through the AWS management console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Dropbox is my publish button</title>
    <link href="http://joshkerr.com/2011/10/dropbox-is-my-publish-button/"/>
    <updated>2011-10-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://joshkerr.com/2011/10/dropbox-is-my-publish-button</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I found this article from Joe Hewitt discussing his blog setup.  He puts all of his posts in a single file which is then parsed and rendered on his server using custom written node.js server code.  He says keeping the single file of posts removes friction from creating new entries.  Not sure I believe that, but ok.  More:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://joehewitt.com/2011/10/03/dropbox-is-my-publish-button&quot;&gt;Dropbox is my publish button&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I flipped the switch on my new blog last night. If you&amp;#8217;ve been here before, you might not notice anything different. The design hasn&amp;#8217;t changed, but behind the scenes everything is new.  I&amp;#8217;ve written a CMS for the blog in &lt;a href=&quot;http://nodejs.org&quot;&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://expressjs.com&quot;&gt;Express&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#8217;s hosted on &lt;a href=&quot;http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/&quot;&gt;EC2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://aws.amazon.com/s3/&quot;&gt;S3&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/&quot;&gt;Cloudfront&lt;/a&gt;. All the content is written in &lt;a href=&quot;http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; and pushed to my server using &lt;a href=&quot;http://dropbox.com&quot;&gt;Dropbox&lt;/a&gt;.  All the code is pulled from repositories on &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com&quot;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://npmjs.org&quot;&gt;NPM&lt;/a&gt;.  I use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/&quot;&gt;responsive design&lt;/a&gt; to adapt nicely to all screen sizes, and use feature testing with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/phiggins42/has.js/&quot;&gt;has.js&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/joehewitt/hascan/&quot;&gt;hascan&lt;/a&gt; to adapt nicely to all browsers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many nerd-minded bloggers, I prefer writing in Markdown in my programming text editor instead of writing in a browser.  Many such systems like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; are growing in popularity, but these usually require you to use Git to push your Markdown files to the server.  Call me lazy, but I don&amp;#8217;t want to have to go down to the command-line.  I just want to save the file to publish it.  This is where Dropbox comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of my blog posts are now in Markdown files, and those files are synchronized to my Linux EC2 servers with Dropbox. My previous blog used Markdown also, but I had to FTP the files to my former Dreamhost server.  I used &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.expandrive.com/&quot;&gt;ExpanDrive&lt;/a&gt;, which made the FTP process relatively painless, but FTP is still flaky, and ExpanDrive doesn&amp;#8217;t deal well with flaky connections.  With Dropbox, the synchronization is effortless. A second or two after I save the Markdown file, the post is up on the blog, and I never have to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Setting up Dropbox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I run the Dropbox Linux client on my EC2 server using the default Linux AMI, but this should work on most Linux distros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start by installing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.dropbox.com/TipsAndTricks/TextBasedLinuxInstall&quot;&gt;Dropbox Linux command line client&lt;/a&gt;.  At the end of the install script, it will ask you to link your Dropbox account by copying and pasting a URL into your browser. &lt;strong&gt;Do not do this yet.&lt;/strong&gt; If you do, it will link your personal Dropbox account to the server, downloading the hundreds of megabytes of files you may have on Dropbox, and exposing potentially sensitive files to any intrepid hacker who breaks into your server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You only want to synchronize the files needed by your CMS, so you need to create a new Dropbox account that is dedicated to this purpose. Of course, the Dropbox client only works with one account at a time, and your personal computer is going to be logged into your personal account.  Luckily, Dropbox folder sharing solves this problem nicely.  Once you have your new account, go to your personal account and share the folder containing your CMS files with the new account.  Then you can link the new account to your server.  Be sure you are logged into the new account in your browser, and then load that URL the installer gave you. Done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About that CMS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dropbox alone does not a blog make.  My new CMS, called &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/joehewitt/nerve/&quot;&gt;Nerve&lt;/a&gt;, processes those magically synchronized files and spits out a website.  It&amp;#8217;s Apache-licensed and hosted on Github, but I&amp;#8217;m not recommending that anyone other than me use it at this time.  You can learn from it, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nerve takes advantage of Node.js&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://nodejs.org/docs/v0.3.1/api/fs.html#fs.watchFile&quot;&gt;built-in file watching&lt;/a&gt; abilities to monitor changes made by Dropbox and then regenerate pages on the fly.  It asks you for a path to your Markdown file, but this can include asterisk wildcards so you can use as many files as the pattern matches.  My entire blog is two Markdown files. One contains all posts from 2002 to 2010 and the other contains all posts from this year.  The files look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;This is a new post
==================

Blah blah blah.

This is another post [9/30/2011]
================================

Blah blah blah.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nerve uses Markdown&amp;#8217;s level-one header to demarcate the posts.  It then looks for a bracketed timestamp in the header to distinguish posts that are public from ones that are still drafts.  A password-protected drafts page allows me to preview drafts before publishing.  Once they are done, I add the timestamp, save the file, and it&amp;#8217;s published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A previous version of Nerve required creating a separate file for each post and giving it a name that contained the timestamp.  I tested this system out on &lt;a href=&quot;http://uponahill.com&quot;&gt;Laura&amp;#8217;s blog&lt;/a&gt; and found that the chore of creating new files was just enough friction to discourage her from starting new posts.  One day I was talking to my friend, &lt;a href=&quot;http://scripting.com&quot;&gt;Dave Winer&lt;/a&gt;, and he told me that his entire blog is contained in a single OPML outline file.  This was a big aha-moment for me, and I rewrote Nerve so that all posts could be within the same file.  This was a big hit with Laura, and I&amp;#8217;ve found her posting volume has gone up significantly ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Caveats&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dropbox Linux client works pretty well, but on a couple occasions I&amp;#8217;ve found it has stopped syncing for no apparent reason.  It&amp;#8217;s not the end of the world.  The web server keeps running, but new posts won&amp;#8217;t get published until I SSH into my EC2 instance and restart the Dropbox daemon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Growl 1.3 now available on the Mac App Store</title>
    <link href="http://joshkerr.com/2011/10/growl-available-in-itunes-store/"/>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tuaw.com/2011/10/03/growl-1-3-now-available-on-the-mac-app-store/&quot;&gt;Growl 1.3 now available on the Mac App Store&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.blogcdn.com//media/2011/10/growl13.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://growl.info/&quot;&gt;Growl&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps the most well-known and popular notification system for OS X, has just released version 1.3 as a Mac App Store exclusive. The previously free notification system has become a paid app with Growl 1.3. As Macstories &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.macstories.net/news/growl-1-3-now-on-the-mac-app-store-1-99-completely-rewritten/&quot;&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;, the reason the Growl team decided to make what was previously a free System Preferences pane into a US$1.99 app was so users would be provided with an up-to-date app utilizing the latest Apple technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what&amp;#8217;s new with Growl 1.3? Almost everything. Growl has been rewritten from the ground up using a new architecture, sporting a new UI, and adding lots of features previous iterations of Growl never had. But not to worry, Growl 1.3 still retains everything you loved about Growl 1.2, they&amp;#8217;ve just added a lot of cool new features to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the coolest new features is a Notification Center-like Rollup window. The window, which is accessed from the Finder&amp;#8217;s menu bar (where you find Growl now), keeps a history of all your notifications that you&amp;#8217;ve received from various apps that use Growl. This is especially handy when you&amp;#8217;re away from your computer and want to see what notifications you missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/growl/id467939042?mt=12&quot;&gt;Growl 1.3&lt;/a&gt; is $1.99 in the Mac App Store. Users also can still download the free System Preference pane version &lt;a href=&quot;http://growl.info/downloads&quot;&gt;1.2.2 here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Overview of Text Editors for Programming on the Mac</title>
    <link href="http://joshkerr.com/2011/10/overview-of-text-editors-mac/"/>
    <updated>2011-10-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://joshkerr.com/2011/10/overview-of-text-editors-mac</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Not a bad overview of the different programming editors on the Mac:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://smyck.net/2011/10/02/text-editors-for-programmers-on-the-mac/&quot;&gt;Overview of Text Editors for Programming on the Mac&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Preface&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last 10 years many new text editors became available for Mac OS X. Since I have tried most of them I wanted to give an overview and a brief description about each one of them. This is for developers that are looking for decent editors on the mac to get their job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets get straight to it then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Editors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Emacs / Vim&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emacs and Vim are really the dinosaurs of text editors for programmers. Both have a immensely rich feature set and can be extended to a degree where you can forget about the OS they are running on. Although there &lt;a href=&quot;http://xkcd.com/378/&quot;&gt;is and always was a strong debate&lt;/a&gt; about which one of the two is superior, it is mostly a matter of personal taste in the end. Both have a steep learning curve and both are probably not something you want to give your web development intern on the first day at the office. However they are really powerful and they have one big advantage in common which is that they are available on a lot of operating systems and are installed by default on most of them. Whenever you log into a linux, bsd, osx or other unix machine you can be sure that vi or emacs or both are already there. On some shared web hosts you can’t even install your own packages so you are stuck with one of them. The cool thing is that you have to learn only one editor and all its specialities and you can work with it on almost any platform and on any remote machine. Since they are both really old they are known to work. They can handle big text files without crashing and for every problem you encounter there is already an extension to solve it. This is why many experienced programmers which started with more modern editors come back to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the features that very few other editors offer are: horizontal and vertical split views, whole project tab completion ( most other editors only complete words from the same file ), fundamental customization of almost every behavior of the editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the features related to programming they are also powerful text editors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both editors have OS X versions with a nice GUI wrapper to make them better integrated citizens, &lt;a href=&quot;http://aquamacs.org/&quot;&gt;AquaEmacs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/macvim/&quot;&gt;MacVim&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really recommend reading the &lt;a href=&quot;http://yehudakatz.com/2010/07/29/everyone-who-tried-to-convince-me-to-use-vim-was-wrong/&quot;&gt;blog post by Yehuda Katz&lt;/a&gt; about switching to MacVim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of them are open source and free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;BBEdit / TextWrangler&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of dinosaurs of course &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/&quot;&gt;BBEdit&lt;/a&gt; and the light weight version called TextWrangler come to mind. They are not as old as Emacs and Vim but BBEdit is around for 20 years! It claims to be the editor »that doesn’t suck« and it is a strong contender. However it is really focussed on text rather than programming. It has a lot of features dealing with plain text manipulation, search and replace etc. but lacks some of the features I need in my daily programming job. It has syntax highlighting, auto completion, syntax checking for a few languages and much more but in the end it always feels a little dusty compared to other editors. For example it supports SVN, CVS and Perforce but not Git in its most recent version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’d recommend BBEdit more to markup authors than to programmers but its worth checking out the website and the trial version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;SubEthaEdit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure how log &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.subethaedit.de/index.html&quot;&gt;SubEthaEdit&lt;/a&gt; exists but its at least 6 or 7 years I’d say. The wikipedia page does not say anything about it so if one of the readers has a more accurate number let me know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SubEthaEdit shines in collaborative editing and most of the time that also applies more to plain text than to programming but still, its a cool feature which allows you to edit text documents via internet or local &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonjour_(software)&quot;&gt;bonjour&lt;/a&gt; connection. Other than that it is also a decent editor for programming with support for a lot of different programming languages. It is simple and does not take a whole lot of time to learn. In the end though it is also limited compared to the other more powerful editors. Non the less I think it belongs on this list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Smultron&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to simple and basic text editors for programming activities you have to take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.peterborgapps.com/smultron/&quot;&gt;Smultron&lt;/a&gt;. It used to be free but now its around 5$ in the Mac App Store. Still quite cheap and it features an icon you can’t miss in your dock! But seriously – its probably one of the most straight forward and simple text editors for the mac. Possibly a good entry point when you are just starting with programming and only need syntax highlighting and other basic editing features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Textmate&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://macromates.com/&quot;&gt;Textmate&lt;/a&gt; was and probably still is the default text editor for many ruby developers. When the web framework Ruby on Rails first came out, the screencasts that came with it demonstrated the editing powers of Textmate so that everybody else started to use it as well. Compared to the other editors that were available at the time it was superior in almost every discipline. It was a lot better integrated into the mac environment compared to emacs or vim, offering standard shortcuts, preferences and native text controls. It supported a lot of languages and so called bundles which are a mixture of snippets, macros and other useful language specific functions like syntax validation or build system integration. It offered more comfort and flexibility than SubEthaEdit or BBEdit. It felt more productive and faster and it was easy to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why am I using the past tense here? Most of this still applies but Textmate did not receive a major update in years. Textmate2 became what Duke Nukem Forever was already famous for: &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporware&quot;&gt;Vaporware&lt;/a&gt;. Just recently some Textmate developer &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.macromates.com/2011/whats-next/&quot;&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; that there would be an alpha release by the end of the year but I won’t believe it until a download link shows up on their website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem with Textmate is mostly its lack of performance with big files, the instability of some really useful extensions and the lack of some features I have learned to love in other text editors like split views for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quit using Textmate because I used some extensions which made it crash to often and because it crashed and locked up when working with big files. Other than that it is still a great editor and its principles were copied to a lot of other editors on other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even today I use it for html, xml and other markup languages because its just the fasted editor to work with in that regard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend trying it. There is a 30-day trial version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Kod&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the people realized that TextMate2 was vaporware and no new version to fix the issues described above was in sight, alternative editors slowly began to appear. One of them is &lt;a href=&quot;http://kodapp.com/&quot;&gt;Kod&lt;/a&gt;, although it is really pretty new it is a very decent and simple to use editor for programming. Its not offering a lot of features, not like Textmate or the other more powerful editors, but still quite useful. If you don’t want to spend a few dollars for Smultron, this might be just the right editor for you. I mentioned Smultron before because it is more mature while Kod is at version 0.0.3. For additional hipness it is worth knowing that its build upon Googles V8 JS engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Sublime Text 2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Kod, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sublimetext.com/&quot;&gt;Sublime Text&lt;/a&gt; appeared as well received alternative to Textmate but compared to Kod it has the same kind of feature set as Textmate and more. It even supports Textmates color themes and language definitions which makes a migration to it quite easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It even has split views and its lighting fast. It has vertical / column selection (like Vim/Emacs/Textmate), multiple line / word select and different ways to expand the current scope of selection. Really, when I tried it the first time I was amazed how snappy it is. Like Textmate it features snippets, macros and build system integration. On the other side its highly configurable though you have to use simple config files instead of the standard OS X preference panes. I’d say its a perfect mixture of Vims configurability and Textmates editing comfort and speed. I highly recommend giving it a try if you are looking for a powerful, feature rich text editor for programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its price tag is a bit higher than others, currently 59$, but I did not have to hesitate long to support the development of this editor after using it for a couple of days in trial mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Vico&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like the concepts of Vim but MacVim is not wrapping enough of Vims “awkwardness” for you then &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vicoapp.com/&quot;&gt;Vico&lt;/a&gt; might be the right editor for you. Basically it uses the vim key bindings and therefore you hardly ever need a mouse to use it and it shows all the shortcuts in a native OS X menu bar. Other than split view support it is a very basic text editor for programming and features a custom scripting language to customize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Chocolat&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is yet another Textmate contender but it is currently in private beta phase and its too early to really judge it as many many features are missing in it. I have to say it has the most intuitive split view implementation of all the editors mentioned here but elementary things like vertical / column selection or parenthesis / scope highlighting are still missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to give it a try nonetheless go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://chocolatapp.com/&quot;&gt;http://chocolatapp.com/&lt;/a&gt; and sign up for the beta or go to their irc channel on the freenode network and ask for an invite. Took me 5 minutes to get one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Coda/Espresso&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These tools, although from different vendors, focus on the same group of people: web developers. They try to bring the entire development tool set together by bundling the functionality together that is otherwise only found in separate tools like file transfers, version control etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried them both but although they bundle together lots of features they are very limited at the same time to a certain flavor of web development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still on the list as I think they will appeal to some people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.panic.com/coda/&quot;&gt;Code&lt;/a&gt; • &lt;a href=&quot;http://macrabbit.com/espresso/&quot;&gt;Espresso&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;skEdit&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.beforedawnsolutions.com/applications/skedit&quot;&gt;skEdit&lt;/a&gt; is the only editor I haven’t used personally yet so I can’t say much about it other that a colleague of mine is using it as his primary editor for quite some time now so I wanted to mention it for completeness sake. Like Coda and Espresso it is focussed on web development but its not as limited to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Final words&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first editor was emacs although I only used it in a very basic way. After that I have used Textmate for a couple of years and switched briefly to MacVim for about half a year. Currently I’m using Sublime Text 2 on a daily basis for my programming work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I don’t like IDE’s. There are programming languages or environments where an IDE is necessary and really superiour to text editors for programmers but I just don’t like these languages or environments either. So please don’t start a “but $IDE does all of that and more” discussion here. This is about text editors only and yes, I know … some text editors are almost like an IDE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I forgot to mention your favorite editor please let me know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a more elaborate list checkout &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_text_editors&quot;&gt;wikipedias comparison of text editors&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mou - new markdown editor for the Mac</title>
    <link href="http://joshkerr.com/2011/10/mou-markdown-editor-mac/"/>
    <updated>2011-10-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://joshkerr.com/2011/10/mou-markdown-editor-mac</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;Screen Shot 2011-10-02 at 10.50.59 AM.png&quot; src=&quot;http://f.cl.ly/items/3j2o2E0V2W1T0X0q1711/Screen%20Shot%202011-10-02%20at%2010.50.59%20AM.png&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;Screen Shot 2011-10-02 at 10.50.59 AM.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mouapp.com/&quot;&gt;Mou&lt;/a&gt; is described as a Markdown editor for web developers.  I displays stylized markdown code on a left pane and then the preview formatted version on the right pane.  As you write on the left, the preview is updated in realtime on the right.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve seen several editors work like this with the code on the left and preview on the right and for the most part it works.  Its nice to see your final formatted document as you write the underlying technical code.  There are however times when this doesn&amp;#8217;t work so well.  If your document has a lot of images in it, the refresh on the preview pane can be distracting as images reload from minor changes you made to the code.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mouapp.com/&quot;&gt;Mou&lt;/a&gt; supports syntax coloring themes which is a bonus so that you don&amp;#8217;t need to write with a white background and black text (it kills my eyes) and instead choose from a variety of sample included themes or provide your own.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The editor also supports auto-completion, incremental search and the ability to change the layout of the editor to support languages other than english.  (For example, you can transform into a vertical layout to support traditional Chinese.)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;d love to see the ability to integrate with my build system, i.e.: be able to run rake tasks or shell commands from the editor.  That way I can write an article, commit it via git and then push it to Heroku to publish live.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Mou is in beta and there are a lot of great features in the pipe, so I&amp;#8217;m keeping tabs on this one.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jobs was livid over native Facebook on HP</title>
    <link href="http://joshkerr.com/2011/10/jobs-livid-over-native-facebook-on-hp/"/>
    <updated>2011-10-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://joshkerr.com/2011/10/jobs-livid-over-native-facebook-on-hp</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yesterday Mashable had an &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.ycombinator.com/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on how Steve Jobs was furious with Facebook over building a client app for WebOS.   It went on to describe some of the earlier failures to work together:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple had fully integrated Facebook into the iPhone and iPad’s operating system, and was ready to launch the mobile-social fusion when API negotiations broke down. Apple, lacking confidence in Facebook’s ability to build a great application, asked to build its own Facebook for iPhone app. Facebook responded with a firm no. Negotiations came to halt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Soon after, Facebook killed Apple’s access to the company’s API.   But why wouldn&amp;#8217;t Facebook let Apple build their API into the OS?  Seems like a win/win scenario for both companies.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Video: A Look At The Fastest Chronograph Watch Ever Made</title>
    <link href="http://joshkerr.com/2011/10/tag-mikrotimer-flying-concept/"/>
    <updated>2011-10-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Techcrunch/~3/zBfTac9gozc/&quot;&gt;Video: A Look At The Fastest Chronograph Watch Ever Made&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img title=&quot;TAGHeuerMikrotimer2&quot; src=&quot;http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/tagheuermikrotimer2.jpeg?w=100&amp;amp;h=70&amp;amp;crop=1&quot; alt=&quot;TAGHeuerMikrotimer2&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;70&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video below shows TAG Heuer’s Mikrotimer Flying 1000 Concept watch in action. This mechanical watch times things to 1/1000th of a second – 300 times faster than a human blink. As the watch spins maniacally, it’s actually meting out 1/1000ths of a second at 500 Hz. That means the small balance wheel inside pops back and forth 3.6 million times an hour – a speed that would shatter many mechanical systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still not impressed? The average Rolex measures time at about 28,800 beats per hour and would probably balk at measuring time at speeds higher than 50,000 bph. As &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hodinkee.com/blog/2011/9/25/exclusive-hands-on-q-just-how-fast-is-tag-heuers-mikrotimer.html&quot;&gt;Hodinkee notes,&lt;/a&gt; the Mikrotimer is an “incredibly powerful caliber.” In short, this watch is a completely mechanical device that runs faster than a sports car engine and comes in a package about as big as a silver dollar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The watch isn’t available – it’s still a concept – but it’s a real beauty and surprisingly unique.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;From the bin of stats that can in no way be accurate or based on anything scientific:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost a third of all women who failed their driving test last year came unstuck due to parallel parking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Estimate: Amazon Kindle Fire sold at $10 loss to build share</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a smart move on Amazon&amp;#8217;s part.  The iPad is on fire, the only way to break in is to undercut with price and provide compelling content.  Amazon is doing both.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feeds.electronista.com/click.phdo?i=d85c086bd58644c0e62e3caf277cd422&quot;&gt;Estimate: Amazon Kindle Fire sold at $10 loss to build share&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

Based on a list of known and expected components, it believes the seven-inch mini tablet costs $209.63 in raw parts and manufacturing, or about $10 less than its $$199 asking price.  A high-quality IPS-based LCD at $87 is a large part of that cost,  while adding the dual-core TI OMAP processor and other mainboard components pushes it up by another $70.40&lt;img src=&quot;http://amch.questionmarket.com/adsc/d887846/17/909940/adscout.php&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
