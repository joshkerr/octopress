  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just spent the past two weeks working with Apple&#8217;s new Xcode 4.0.  I&#8217;ve got mixed feelings.  Some areas I see big improvements such as the single document view, and in other areas, it feels like Xcode is less capable than its predecessor.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think you NEED to upgrade to Xcode 4.  Apple will accept app submissions for any of their stores via Xcode 3.  Xcode 4 though does make the submission process a lot easier.  For one, they let you choose which certificate to apply after the build process.  So code signing with a new certificate doesn&#8217;t require you to rebuild.</p>

<p><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/MegaErase%20from%20Xcode%20Submit.png" alt="XcodeShot" /></p>

<p>The screenshot above shows the Xcode Organizer which is used to share your app or submit it to the App Store.  It is also sort of a snapshot backup system, making a compressed version of the output of your project.</p>

<p>Configuring builds, targets, etc.. are all easier in Xcode 4.  Apple does a good job of visualizing the different settings and allowing you to easily make changes.</p>

<p><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/MegaErase%20-%20MegaErase.xcodeproj.png" alt="XcodeShot2" /></p>

<p>Apple has made a lot of progress on its source code repository management with new support for Git.  They also have the ability to do file comparison directly in the main editor.</p>

<p>Another feature built right into the editor is Interface Builder.  I&#8217;m not sure this is such a good thing.  In a lot of ways, Interface Builder is step back in Xcode 4.  For one, it doesn&#8217;t support plugins.  So if you are using a third party framework and you want to take advantage of a plugin, you are out of luck.  Not cool.</p>

<p>Apple&#8217;s dev tools are very well done.  It is a pleasure working with them to create iPhone, iPad and Mac apps.  If Objective C had its own memory management system, I&#8217;d say that they had a near perfect platform.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m a big fan of the Alaska Airlines flight from Austin to San Jose.  I take it regularly now that I&#8217;m working for YouSendIt and it has quickly become my favorite airline and flight.  There is Wifi on the plane and it works great through the Gogo service, the flight attendants are really great, and it is all reasonably priced.  Lastly, for some wonderful reason that I can&#8217;t explain I get upgraded automatically to first class.</p>

<p>With all those great amenities, you could understand why I&#8217;m upset to hear that they&#8217;ve cancelled the service between Austin and San Jose.  Their official word is that they want to focus more on the Northwest region but I think it has more to do with competition from the newly announced Southwest Airlines service.  Just when I started to get real comfortable they go and shut it down.  I&#8217;m not happy.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been interested in learning more about the Mac App store so I figured I&#8217;d whip up something in my spare time.  Being security conscious I decided to write a simple secure erase program that I could access via the menu bar.  The use case is that there are several files that I need to securely erase and rather than &#8220;secure empty&#8221; my trash which could take hours, I could just drag those files into a menu bar icon which would securely erase them.</p>

<p>When I say securely erase, I mean the type of delete procedure where the file cannot be retrieved (EVER.)  So I whipped me up an app.  You erase files by dropping the on the menu bar icon:</p>

<p><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/MegaErase.png" alt="menu bar icon" /></p>

<p>This is the dialog that will appear:</p>

<p><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Deleting%20files.png" alt="delete dialog" /></p>

<p>You can see what is happening in the background via the console window:</p>

<p><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/MegaErase%20Console.png" alt="console" /></p>

<p>And lastly here is the preferences dialog:</p>

<p><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Preferences.png" alt="preferences" /></p>

<p>This is a work in progress so there are a lot of elements that need to be completed.  I wrote the app in Xcode 4 in about 6 hours a few weekends ago.  It is multi-threaded and uses the standard unix srm command to destroy the files.  I plan to make it so that you can switch up the delete command so that the app uses a different command line app (like bcwipe.)</p>

<p>I want to implement a queue which would persist between launches of the app.  That way you could queue up a ton of files, turn off your computer, turn it back on and let the app continue where it left off.  You should also be able to queue up more files while it is currently operating on a series of files.</p>

<p>I think I&#8217;m going to give it away for free.   I haven&#8217;t released it to the Mac App Store yet but plan to in the next day or so.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have a Macbook Pro which has 8gigs of RAM, a super fast processor, and runs dog slow.  Knowing that the bottle neck is usually the HD, I went out and bought an SSD drive to replace the existing HD.  This worked for a little bit until the SSD became too fragmented from lack of TRIM support.  Now my notebook is slower than it was with a regular HD.</p>

<p>I did some research and learned that SSD drives are great for boot devices, but not so good as scratch devices.  Ahhh.   So now I know what to do.  I quickly ordered an OWC <a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/item/Other%20World%20Computing/DDAMBS0GB/">data doubler</a> which would let me mount a second HD where my optical drive is.  (I never use my optical drive.)   I used <a href="http://diglloydtools.com/disktester.html">disk tester</a> to recondition my SSD drive.  Lastly I reconfigured my OS to put the /Users folder on my 2nd HD.</p>

It was really creepy at first, but then really interesting.  I actually sat around and watched others move the cursor around the spreadsheet, type in their data, it was very voyeur like.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got the honor of being one of the three judges at <a href="http://austin.startupweekend.org/about/">Startup Weekend Austin</a> today.  There were 10 different groups each presenting a company that they had incubated over the weekend.  The ideas were mostly good, some were downright hilarious and a few seemed to have legs.  I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;d go out and invest in any one of them, but I&#8217;d certainly consider taking equity in return for a role as an advisor.</p>

<p>Microsoft hosted the event in their new offices in North Austin and they did a great job providing a forum for these entrepreneurs to work in.  Many came from outside of Austin, Dallas, San Antonio and even one guy from Oklahoma.  Most had day jobs and a few were actually fairly successful and looking for something a bit more challenging that their usual routine.</p>

<p>It was fun and in the end we had to choose a winner.  Not easy, but that is the way the game works.</p>
