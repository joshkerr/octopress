  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been interested in learning more about the Mac App store so I figured I&#8217;d whip up something in my spare time.  Being security conscious I decided to write a simple secure erase program that I could access via the menu bar.  The use case is that there are several files that I need to securely erase and rather than &#8220;secure empty&#8221; my trash which could take hours, I could just drag those files into a menu bar icon which would securely erase them.</p>

<p>When I say securely erase, I mean the type of delete procedure where the file cannot be retrieved (EVER.)  So I whipped me up an app.  You erase files by dropping the on the menu bar icon:</p>

<p><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/MegaErase.png" alt="menu bar icon" /></p>

<p>This is the dialog that will appear:</p>

<p><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Deleting%20files.png" alt="delete dialog" /></p>

<p>You can see what is happening in the background via the console window:</p>

<p><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/MegaErase%20Console.png" alt="console" /></p>

<p>And lastly here is the preferences dialog:</p>

<p><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Preferences.png" alt="preferences" /></p>

<p>This is a work in progress so there are a lot of elements that need to be completed.  I wrote the app in Xcode 4 in about 6 hours a few weekends ago.  It is multi-threaded and uses the standard unix srm command to destroy the files.  I plan to make it so that you can switch up the delete command so that the app uses a different command line app (like bcwipe.)</p>

<p>I want to implement a queue which would persist between launches of the app.  That way you could queue up a ton of files, turn off your computer, turn it back on and let the app continue where it left off.  You should also be able to queue up more files while it is currently operating on a series of files.</p>

<p>I think I&#8217;m going to give it away for free.   I haven&#8217;t released it to the Mac App Store yet but plan to in the next day or so.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have a Macbook Pro which has 8gigs of RAM, a super fast processor, and runs dog slow.  Knowing that the bottle neck is usually the HD, I went out and bought an SSD drive to replace the existing HD.  This worked for a little bit until the SSD became too fragmented from lack of TRIM support.  Now my notebook is slower than it was with a regular HD.</p>

<p>I did some research and learned that SSD drives are great for boot devices, but not so good as scratch devices.  Ahhh.   So now I know what to do.  I quickly ordered an OWC <a href="http://eshop.macsales.com/item/Other%20World%20Computing/DDAMBS0GB/">data doubler</a> which would let me mount a second HD where my optical drive is.  (I never use my optical drive.)   I used <a href="http://diglloydtools.com/disktester.html">disk tester</a> to recondition my SSD drive.  Lastly I reconfigured my OS to put the /Users folder on my 2nd HD.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I got the honor of being one of the three judges at <a href="http://austin.startupweekend.org/about/">Startup Weekend Austin</a> today.  There were 10 different groups each presenting a company that they had incubated over the weekend.  The ideas were mostly good, some were downright hilarious and a few seemed to have legs.  I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;d go out and invest in any one of them, but I&#8217;d certainly consider taking equity in return for a role as an advisor.</p>

<p>Microsoft hosted the event in their new offices in North Austin and they did a great job providing a forum for these entrepreneurs to work in.  Many came from outside of Austin, Dallas, San Antonio and even one guy from Oklahoma.  Most had day jobs and a few were actually fairly successful and looking for something a bit more challenging that their usual routine.</p>

<p>It was fun and in the end we had to choose a winner.  Not easy, but that is the way the game works.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My blog is mostly static content.  I write the articles, pass them through Jekyll which transforms them into static HTML and then they get pushed up to my Heroku box where they are served.  This system works great until you want to have a live activity feed.  I&#8217;ve got one on my main page showing the latest from RSS feeds on Twitter, Google Reader, Github and a few others.  You could probably manage this in javascript, but Heroku and Ruby came calling so this is how I created my feed.</p>

<p><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/myfeed.png" alt="ScreenShotOfFeed" /></p>

<p>First I thought, okay I&#8217;ll just parse the feeds after the page loads.  I hooked in some javascript:</p>

<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='javascript'>&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/
    libs/jquery/1.3.2/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; 
    &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;$(document).ready(function()
    {$(&quot;#elsewhere&quot;).load(&quot;/feed/&quot;);});&lt;/script&gt;</code>
  </pre>
</div>


<p>Next I thought I&#8217;d just read the feeds.  I found this great Ruby gem called <a href="http://github.com/pauldix/feedzirra">Feedzirra</a> which fetches and parses RSS and ATOM feeds.  Perfect.  I implemented it and boom, I had feeds.  But I also had a problem.  The feeds took time to load and the more URL&#8217;s that I add, the longer they will take.  People aren&#8217;t going to sit around waiting for them.  Time to cache.</p>

<p>At first I thought I would write the feeds to a file on Heroku and then just read that.  Not going to happen.  Heroku does not let you write local files.  So I need to either keep this data in memory, but how?</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://redis.io">Redis</a> a key value store with high performance and low overhead.  This will work, but I want to store my Ruby objects in there, how am I going to do that?  Enter <a href="http://github.com/soveran/ohm">Ohm</a> object hash mapping for Redis.  Perfect, now I can write my feed.  (I&#8217;m just starting with Ruby, so the following is a hack.)</p>

<h3>Model</h3>

<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='ruby'>require 'ohm'
  
  class Feeder &lt; Ohm::Model
    attribute :title
    attribute :published
    attribute :feed_id

    attribute :service
    index :published

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I wrote this code pretty quickly and it would probably scale well.  Heroku and Ruby are a pretty powerful combination.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It has been too long since I&#8217;ve launched Xcode and with the new 4.0 version, I feel like I&#8217;m learning to program all over again.  I don&#8217;t need to use 4.0, I could continue to use 3.x as Apple will still accept App Store submissions with the older version, but I want to stay current and the new debugger is too good to pass up.</p>

<p><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/new_single_window20100721.jpeg" alt="XcodeScreenShot" /></p>

<p>Xcode 4 is a significant upgrade for developers, offering a new IDE with a single view, a mechanism to automatically fix syntax mistakes, and a logic analyzer (not the hardware kind) that will find issues with your code logic.</p>

<p><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/new_drag20100721.jpeg" alt="XcodeScreenShot2" /></p>

<p>Since it has been a while since I&#8217;ve written any iOS code, the new version of Xcode feels about as alien as the previous version.  Most of my coding work of late has been in the web or not at all.  I&#8217;m not a full time developer by trade, but I do enjoying writing code when I get the chance.</p>

<p>The one thing that Apple does well that they don&#8217;t quite get enough praise for is their software.  iOS, the dev tools, Final Cut Pro, all of it is really pretty amazing.  Some of the best software available from a commercial source.  Okay, enough praise, back to work.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I used to host my blog at <a href="http://www.mediatemple.com">Media Temple</a> which provided a great virtual dedicated hosting platform called (ve).  The server gives you full control and hosting starts at $30 a month.  Very reasonable and very powerful.  Recently I switched to <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> for blogging which allows you to pre-generate content so that you only need to deploy static files to your web server.  With a system like this in place, there is no need for a database or app server, just a simple web server.  You could use a system like <a href="http://www.ngnix.org">Ngnix</a> which reduces your overhead pretty significantly.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m currently using an <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">Amazon EC2</a> micro server to host this blog and I plan to eventually move to S3 for hosting as soon as Amazon allows me to point my DNS A records at it.  (They currently only allow CNAME records.)</p>

<p>Setup is not easy on Amazon, you are going to need to configure a complete server so I don&#8217;t recommend it for novice users.  There are freely available pre-built servers that are provided by the Amazon community, but I don&#8217;t recommend those because you really never know what someone else installed.  I&#8217;ve seen root keys embedded in the default profile so that someone could root your box with their own key.</p>

<p>One of the big advantages of Amazon EC2 over a provider like Media Temple is that you can easily spawn a new site based on your old one, test out some new settings, and then shut it down, all without needing to pay more than the few hours of time that you had the server running.  (Amazon bills hourly for servers.)  With Media Temple, I&#8217;m having to throw down a month&#8217;s worth of cash just to turn on a new box.</p>

<p>I would still recommend <a href="http://www.mediatemple.com">Media Temple</a> for those that don&#8217;t want to mess with managing their own servers.  For me, I&#8217;m staying with <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">Amazon EC2</a>.</p>

<h3>Update</h3>

<p>Okay, so I&#8217;m not staying with Amazon EC2.  In the end I switched to <a href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a>.  Part of my blog has a feed that shows you my most recent activity across Google Reader, Github, Twitter, etc..  In order to generate that feed, I need to execute a PHP script.  Or do I?  Turns out I don&#8217;t really need a real-time feed, so I just generate the feed when I deploy another blog posting.</p>

<p>So, with that, I decided to deploy my blog to <a href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a>.  Wow is this thing fast.  So what is <a href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a>?  It is a platform to host Ruby apps.  Why would I choose this over Amazon?  Well for one it is cheap as hell.  (Free for small stuff.)  The other consideration is that this platform uses a pure git workflow which is something that I find very appealing.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll post up a &#8220;how to host your jekyll blog on Heroku&#8221; article in the near future.</p>
