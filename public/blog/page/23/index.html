  <div class="entry-content"><p>I’m a big fan of watching movies on my Apple TV, iPad and sometimes iPhone.  There is a lot of free and legal content that is available to download from the net and I’ve been collecting it,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcoding">transcoding</a> it, <a href="http://joshkerr.com/2010/04/21/use-iflicks-to-add-meta-data-to-your-movies">tagging</a> it and adding it to my iTunes library.</p>

<p>Since all of the device that I use to view the material support 720P, I am usually working with source content that is high-def and packaged in an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matroska">MKV</a> container which is not supported by any of the IOS devices so I need to re-encode it.  In the past I used Handbrake which works wonders for taking a video in one format and transcoding it into another format.  This is a CPU intensive task and it can take an hour to encode a 40 minute video stream.</p>

<p>Seeking a faster way to get my videos into the correct format, I did a little research and learned that 720P MKV files actually contain a H.264 video stream.  You don’t need to transcode it.  To make these files compatible with an IOS device you just need to transcode the audio into AAC and then re-package into an MP4 or M4V container.</p>

<h2>MKVTools</h2>

<p>Doing a bit more research I found <a href="http://www.emmgunn.com/mokgvm2dvd/mokgvmhome.html">MKVTools</a> which is essentially an Applescript app that will do this for you automatically resulting in a much faster conversion.  How much faster?  That same 40 minute video stream now transcodes in 4 minutes.  Since the video is already encoded, all you need to do is extract it, re-encode the audio, and then MUX it back together.</p>

<p><a href="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/MKVtools.png"><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/MKVtools.png" alt="MKV Tools Screenshot" /></a></p>

<p>In MKVTools select the MP4 option, choose Pass Thru for video and AAC (2CH) for audio.  I also select the iPad under Device and then hit the <strong>Convert</strong> button.</p>

<p>I’ve been working with MKVTools for a few days now and it seems to work very well.  I haven’t noticed any strange artifacts in the video or audio, everything syncs up nicely and it even handles subtitles.  The price tag on this tool is $4.99 which I gladly paid.</p>

<h2>iFlicks</h2>

<p>If you are an organization freak like myself, you probably want to tag your M4V files before you load them into iTunes.  This will ensure that they have the right descriptions, episode ID’s and even poster art.  The files will look just like the content you buy directly from the iTunes store.  I use a program called <a href="http://www.iflicksapp.com/">iFlicks</a> to do this.</p>

<p>iFlicks will take the output M4V file from MKVTools and lookup the file name in themoviedb.org and TVDB.com to try to determine what it is.  Once it determines the name of the movie or tv show, it will tag it with all the required data including the poster art.  Click the “Start” button and the results are written to the file and loaded into iTunes.  It couldn’t be easier.</p>

<p><a href="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/The.Social.Network.2010.DvdScr.Xvid.AC3-THC.avi.png"><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/The.Social.Network.2010.DvdScr.Xvid.AC3-THC.avi.png" alt="Social Network iFlicks screenshot" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/iTunes.png"><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/iTunes.png" alt="iTunes Screenshot" /></a></p>

<p>iFlicks is $20 euros and the developer updates the application regularly.  There is however one catch in this workflow that can be easily resolved.  MKTools does not automatically load the resulting M4V files into iFlicks.  You have the manually drag them into the application.</p>

<h2>Hazel</h2>

<p>This is where <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php">Hazel</a> comes into play.  Hazel is a folder watching service which can apply rules to those folders.  For me, I use it to look for processed M4V files and load them automatically into iFlicks.  You could probably achieve the same result using folder actions, but Hazel makes it so easy.</p>

<p>This workflow is great for getting MKV 720P files into iTunes and in a great high quality that is compatible with the latest IOS devices including the new Apple TV.  It would be really cool if someone were to build all this functionality into a single app.  (I’m talking to you Mr. MKVTools author.)</p>

<h2>iFlicks 1.3.0 Beta</h2>

<p>It turns out that the newest version of iFlicks now support transcoding MKV files into M4V without the needing to re-encode the video.  This is great news and for those of you who want to try it out you can get it form their <a href="href=%22http://groups.google.com/group/iflicks/browse_thread/thread/d10236fd31cd87f7">Google Groups</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Okay, this is really cool.  Since 90% of the makeup of a common household cleaner is water, why not ship it without the water and let the consumer fill it with their own?

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Tyler Hall, a web guy over at Yahoo wrote this great script that will automatically sort through your Amazon S3 stored images and run them through Yahoo&#8217;s autosmash to optimize them for faster web performance.</p>


<p>Why should this concern you?  First, you should not be hosting your blog&#8217;;s images from your blog web site.  You should be using a CDN (content delivery network) just in case you get a front page link on the New York Times or Reddit which would cause thousands of users to suddenly come visit your site.  Hosting those images from your site would kill your site.  (Think denial of service.)</p>


<p>If you are using Wordpress you should also be using TanTan Noodles Amazon S3<a href="http://tantannoodles.com/toolkit/wordpress-s3/">plugin</a>.  This plugin will automatically place uploaded images on your in your S3 account.  Amazon is a low cost CDN and this plugin makes its use seamless.</p>


<p>Now add in Autosmush and you can have your photos optimized not only in size (without loss of quality,) but to last in your browsers cache for a longer period of time.  So rather than requesting the same image over and over, it will grab the image from its cache thus cutting back on a lot of the requests to your server.</p>


<p>Everything you need to install and use this script is available on Tyler&#8217;;s github account.  I&#8217;;ve been using it for a month now and it works great.</p>

      <p class="meta">





  



<time datetime="2010-10-30T00:00:00-05:00" pubdate  data-updated="true" >Oct 30<span>th</span>, 2010</time></p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>There is no question that you want your data backed up to the cloud and the cheapest way to do that is by using Amazon S3.  For more people, their hosted servers provide some sort of web based automated backup system.  For those of us that manage our own servers, yo&#8217;ll need to configure something yourself.  This task can be fairly straight forward and I&#8217;ll show you how I&#8217;ve configured mine.</p>

<p>The key tool that we are going to use is a program called duplicity which will support incremental encrypted backups to Amazon.  Before we get started yo&#8217;ll need an Amazon S3 account with a bucket configured for your backups.  I&#8217;m not going to show you how to do that in this article as it is pretty straight forward.</p>

<p>Next, you&#8217;ll want to choose which directories on your server you want to backup.  For me, I&#8217;m backing up the following</p>

<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='bash'>/home/
/etc/
/usr/
/lib/
/opt/
/root/
/var/</code>
  </pre>
</div>


<p>This gives me all that I&#8217;d need to reconfigure my server in case of complete server failure.  It isn&#8217;t a complete drive clone, but I don&#8217;t really need that.</p>

<p>To install duplicity, you&#8217;ll need to make sure that your apt-get library is up to date.</p>

<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='bash'>apt-get update</code>
  </pre>
</div>


<p>Next you&#8217;ll want to install duplicity:</p>

<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='bash'>apt-get install duplicity</code>
  </pre>
</div>


<p>With duplicity installed, all that is left is your backup script.  You probably shouldn&#8217;t leave the PASSPHRASE in the script and you will need to replace they [KEY-ID] and [SEC-KEY] with your own Amazon information.  Here is a copy of mine:</p>

<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='bash'>#!/bin/bash

#Log script
log() { logger -t scriptname &quot;$@&quot;; echo &quot;$@&quot;; }

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=[KEY-ID]
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=[SEC-KEY]
export PASSPHRASE=[PASSWORD]

duplicity /home/ s3+http://joshkerr/joshkerr-com/home/
duplicity /etc/ s3+http://joshkerr/joshkerr-com/etc/
duplicity /usr/ s3+http://joshkerr/joshkerr-com/usr/
duplicity /lib/ s3+http://joshkerr/joshkerr-com/lib/
duplicity /opt/ s3+http://joshkerr/joshkerr-com/opt/
duplicity /root/ s3+http://joshkerr/joshkerr-com/root/
duplicity /var/ s3+http://joshkerr/joshkerr-com/var/

log &quot;Backup completed.&quot;

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
export PASSPHRASE</code>
  </pre>
</div>


<p>Its a good thing I posted this article shortly before I decided to upgrade my server to Ubuntu 10.04 LTS because it basically wiped clean my drive.  Hey MediaTemple, where is the heads up?  They do put your old data in the /old folder, but it was way easier to restore from Amazon S3.  Thank you duplicity.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://mailgun.net/">Mailgun</a> is a service that provides a web-server API for fully managed, scalable email servers.  This is something that I think would work great with a service like <a href="http://www.zosh.com">Zosh</a>.</p>


<p>If you run a web application that needs to process email, the best way to get that email into your app server would be to have it posted.  You provide some sort of secure page and emails are posted via an HTTP POST.  Sendmail will let you do this, but there aren&#8217;t a lot of other email servers that have this kind of capability.  This is where Mailgun comes in.  They will post a UTF-8 format email to the URL that you specify.  You get all parts of the email including the attachments and you can process it as if it was ordinary data.  You can even apply pattern matching before the email reaches your app server.</p>


<p>This is very powerful as it can be used to setup routes for certain emails.  For example lets say that we want to assign each user on our system their own @joshkerr.com email address.  Using this system we can easily route all shipping@joshkerr.com emails to a different location than the invoicing@joshkerr.com emails.</p>




<p>Mailgun provides a host of libraries to get you started including Ruby, PHP, Python, Java and C#.  <a href="http://mailgun.net/pricing">Pricing</a> is reasonable and I&#8217;m really tempted to use their service for one of my projects.  If anyone has any experience with them, please post to the comments.</p>




<p>Here is some sample code showing an HTTP POST:</p>




<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='ruby'>def upload(request):
     if request.method == 'POST':
         sender    = request.POST.get('sender')
         recipient = request.POST.get('recipient')
         subject   = request.POST.get('subject', '')

         body_html  = request.POST.get('body-html', '')
         body_plain = request.POST.get('body-plain', '')

         for key in request.FILES:
             file = request.FILES[key]
             # do_something_cool_with(file)

     # Returned text is ignored but HTTP status code matters:
     # Mailgun wants to see 200, otherwise it will make another attempt
     return HttpResponse('OK')</code>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>PageLines is a premium Wordpress theme maker and they just recently released their <a href="http://www.pagelines.com/demos/platformpro/">PlatformPro</a> theme which is more like a drag and drop content management system for Wordpress than it is a theme.  I&#8217;m using it now on joshkerr.com and the more I dig into it, the more impressed I am with its capabilities to produce a stunning website.  What separates PlatformPro from other standard wordpress themes is the amount of customization that you can perform from the Wordpress admin section.</p>




<p>The theme itself isn&#8217;t so much a theme, but a whole layer of user interface controls which can be easily manipulated via a very simple control panel.  This powerful functionality allows you to take a simple Wordpress blog and add features like: </p>




<p>Universal sidebars, carousels, <a href="http://www.pagelines.com/demos/platformpro/features">feature boxes</a> and much more.  I can&#8217;t stress how easy it is to put together and manage a very powerful and professional looking website with PlatformPro.  Now while all of this sounds great, the PlatformPro product is fairly new and there are a few bugs here and there.  The people at PageLines have been quick to fix them with new releases and upgrading your installation is pretty easy using the built in theme upgrade functionality within Wordpress 3.  I&#8217;m using PlatformPro on several websites now and I&#8217;m pretty happy with it.  For more information check out the <a href="http://www.pagelines.com/">PageLines web site</a>.  It costs $95 and requires Wordpress 3.0 and above with PHP version 5 and above.</p>
