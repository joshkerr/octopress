  <div class="entry-content"><p>My blog is mostly static content.  I write the articles, pass them through Jekyll which transforms them into static HTML and then they get pushed up to my Heroku box where they are served.  This system works great until you want to have a live activity feed.  I&#8217;ve got one on my main page showing the latest from RSS feeds on Twitter, Google Reader, Github and a few others.  You could probably manage this in javascript, but Heroku and Ruby came calling so this is how I created my feed.</p>

<p><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/myfeed.png" alt="ScreenShotOfFeed" /></p>

<p>First I thought, okay I&#8217;ll just parse the feeds after the page loads.  I hooked in some javascript:</p>

<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='javascript'>&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/
    libs/jquery/1.3.2/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; 
    &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;$(document).ready(function()
    {$(&quot;#elsewhere&quot;).load(&quot;/feed/&quot;);});&lt;/script&gt;</code>
  </pre>
</div>


<p>Next I thought I&#8217;d just read the feeds.  I found this great Ruby gem called <a href="http://github.com/pauldix/feedzirra">Feedzirra</a> which fetches and parses RSS and ATOM feeds.  Perfect.  I implemented it and boom, I had feeds.  But I also had a problem.  The feeds took time to load and the more URL&#8217;s that I add, the longer they will take.  People aren&#8217;t going to sit around waiting for them.  Time to cache.</p>

<p>At first I thought I would write the feeds to a file on Heroku and then just read that.  Not going to happen.  Heroku does not let you write local files.  So I need to either keep this data in memory, but how?</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://redis.io">Redis</a> a key value store with high performance and low overhead.  This will work, but I want to store my Ruby objects in there, how am I going to do that?  Enter <a href="http://github.com/soveran/ohm">Ohm</a> object hash mapping for Redis.  Perfect, now I can write my feed.  (I&#8217;m just starting with Ruby, so the following is a hack.)</p>

<h3>Model</h3>

<div>
  <pre>
    <code class='ruby'>require 'ohm'
  
  class Feeder &lt; Ohm::Model
    attribute :title

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I wrote this code pretty quickly and it would probably scale well.  Heroku and Ruby are a pretty powerful combination.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It has been too long since I&#8217;ve launched Xcode and with the new 4.0 version, I feel like I&#8217;m learning to program all over again.  I don&#8217;t need to use 4.0, I could continue to use 3.x as Apple will still accept App Store submissions with the older version, but I want to stay current and the new debugger is too good to pass up.</p>

<p><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/new_single_window20100721.jpeg" alt="XcodeScreenShot" /></p>

<p>Xcode 4 is a significant upgrade for developers, offering a new IDE with a single view, a mechanism to automatically fix syntax mistakes, and a logic analyzer (not the hardware kind) that will find issues with your code logic.</p>

<p><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/new_drag20100721.jpeg" alt="XcodeScreenShot2" /></p>

<p>Since it has been a while since I&#8217;ve written any iOS code, the new version of Xcode feels about as alien as the previous version.  Most of my coding work of late has been in the web or not at all.  I&#8217;m not a full time developer by trade, but I do enjoying writing code when I get the chance.</p>

<p>The one thing that Apple does well that they don&#8217;t quite get enough praise for is their software.  iOS, the dev tools, Final Cut Pro, all of it is really pretty amazing.  Some of the best software available from a commercial source.  Okay, enough praise, back to work.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I used to host my blog at <a href="http://www.mediatemple.com">Media Temple</a> which provided a great virtual dedicated hosting platform called (ve).  The server gives you full control and hosting starts at $30 a month.  Very reasonable and very powerful.  Recently I switched to <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> for blogging which allows you to pre-generate content so that you only need to deploy static files to your web server.  With a system like this in place, there is no need for a database or app server, just a simple web server.  You could use a system like <a href="http://www.ngnix.org">Ngnix</a> which reduces your overhead pretty significantly.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m currently using an <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">Amazon EC2</a> micro server to host this blog and I plan to eventually move to S3 for hosting as soon as Amazon allows me to point my DNS A records at it.  (They currently only allow CNAME records.)</p>

<p>Setup is not easy on Amazon, you are going to need to configure a complete server so I don&#8217;t recommend it for novice users.  There are freely available pre-built servers that are provided by the Amazon community, but I don&#8217;t recommend those because you really never know what someone else installed.  I&#8217;ve seen root keys embedded in the default profile so that someone could root your box with their own key.</p>

<p>One of the big advantages of Amazon EC2 over a provider like Media Temple is that you can easily spawn a new site based on your old one, test out some new settings, and then shut it down, all without needing to pay more than the few hours of time that you had the server running.  (Amazon bills hourly for servers.)  With Media Temple, I&#8217;m having to throw down a month&#8217;s worth of cash just to turn on a new box.</p>

<p>I would still recommend <a href="http://www.mediatemple.com">Media Temple</a> for those that don&#8217;t want to mess with managing their own servers.  For me, I&#8217;m staying with <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">Amazon EC2</a>.</p>

<h3>Update</h3>

<p>Okay, so I&#8217;m not staying with Amazon EC2.  In the end I switched to <a href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a>.  Part of my blog has a feed that shows you my most recent activity across Google Reader, Github, Twitter, etc..  In order to generate that feed, I need to execute a PHP script.  Or do I?  Turns out I don&#8217;t really need a real-time feed, so I just generate the feed when I deploy another blog posting.</p>

<p>So, with that, I decided to deploy my blog to <a href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a>.  Wow is this thing fast.  So what is <a href="http://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a>?  It is a platform to host Ruby apps.  Why would I choose this over Amazon?  Well for one it is cheap as hell.  (Free for small stuff.)  The other consideration is that this platform uses a pure git workflow which is something that I find very appealing.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll post up a &#8220;how to host your jekyll blog on Heroku&#8221; article in the near future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just finished watching a horrible YouTube video of the Bahrain military firing into an unarmed peaceful protest killing several people.  Looking at the date on the video, it was recorded only hours ago.  Technology is empowering people and over throwing governments.</p>

<iframe title="YouTube video player" width="549" height="339" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/_Hdlrd4tyx4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>It was only a few weeks ago that Egypt under similar circumstances found itself powerless to the force of viral media as protesters published hours of video to YouTube and Facebook.  The results saw the government toppled after decades of tyrannic rule.</p>

<p>The power of the mob combined with the mobile phone &amp; social media is a powerful combination.  (I was going to write more, but I got busy.  I know, lame.)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As part of my day job, i got to attend the <a href="http://www.rsaconference.com/">RSA security conference</a> going on now in San Francisco.  I spent some time walking through the different booths and came away with a feeling that there isn&#8217;t much innovation happening in the industry.  There is a strong push toward the cloud and cloud based security, but from a security technology perspective, you&#8217;ve got the same techniques applied to updated hardware and software.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m no security expert, actually far from it, so my first job was to find out what RSA stands for.  I asked four different attendees and not a single one knew.  I ended up Googling it and learned that it stands for Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman, the inventors of the algorithm for public key encryption.  Like those that I quizzed, it is doubtful that I will commit those names to memory.</p>

<p>I spoke to many different people representing all types of big enterprise, from government defense to banking to IT consulting.  Most were looking for new ways to improve their security, trying to lower the costs of fraud and information leakage.  I didn&#8217;t see anything at the conference that indicates that consumers or businesses will be any safer in the coming years.  In fact, I&#8217;d go so far to say that as we become more dependent on wireless devices for transactions such as payment, we&#8217;ll become even more vulnerable.</p>

<p>Depressing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.about.me">About.me</a> ran in private beta for about 3 months before they launched.  Shortly after they did launch (four days) they were acquired by AOL.  Paul Hontz from the <a href="http://thestartupfoundry.com/2011/02/12/why-about-me-was-acquired-by-aol-for-millions-four-days-after-launch/">Startup Foundry</a> wrote a great <a href="http://thestartupfoundry.com/2011/02/12/why-about-me-was-acquired-by-aol-for-millions-four-days-after-launch/">article</a> detailing how they were able to pull off such a quick exit.  It makes for a good read.</p>

<p>In addition to the author&#8217;s points on why they were so successful at attracting users, they also allowed users to reserve their username prior to the launch of the service.  Given the importance of getting your name in the URL, users jumped on the opportunity and this built momentum toward their launch.</p>

<p>If you download TV shows on your computer, chances are good you get them from iTunes.  Nothing wrong with that.  If you are a bit more technical, then you might download your shows from news groups.  If you are even more technical, you use NZB files and download your shows from indexed websites.  If you are even more technical, you&#8217;ve got <a href="http://www.sabnzbd.org">Sabnzbd</a> setup and you use that to process your downloads.  In this article, I&#8217;m going to show you how to setup <a href="http://sickbeard.com/">Sickbeard</a> to automatically download your TV shows.</p>

<p><a href="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Sickbeard.png"><img src="http://joshkerr.s3.amazonaws.com/images/Sickbeard.png" alt="SickBeardPhoto" /></a></p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<ul>
<li>A mac</li>
<li>Knowledge of NZB files</li>
<li>A configured running version of Sabnzbd</li>
<li>Some technical expertise</li>
</ul>


<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>First go here and follow this instruction manual:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.jetshred.com/archive/installing-sickbeard-on-mac-os-10-6/">Good OSX install manual for Sickbeard</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Then go here and setup your copy of <a href="http://sickbeard.com/">Sickbeard</a> to load automatically at startup:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://sickbeard.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=87">How to get Sickbeard to startup automatically at login</a></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-0211-privacy-20110211,0,6098077.story?track=rss">La Times</a> ran an article today covering the CA State Supreme Court&#8217;s ruling that retailers in can no longer ask customers for Zip Codes when paying with a credit card.   Apparently the Zip Code is considered a personal piece of identification.  Seriously?</p>

<p>There are probably over 10,000 people living in my Zip Code.  Its about as personal as a stadium full of people.  I think it is ridiculous and I hope that a higher court overturns.  Meanwhile, there are a dozen or so lawsuits against major retailers that are going to be impacted by this.  The ruling is supposed to protect customers from credit card fraud and identity theft.  I think stupidity will continue to be the main problem with fraud and theft.  This ruling isn&#8217;t likely to help much.</p>
